#+TITLE: emacs-noty Example Wiki

This directory is an example emacs-noty wiki.  You can either use
it directly as your =noty-source-root= or create a fresh wiki by
running:

#+begin_example
M-x noty-setup-wiki
#+end_example

and choosing a new directory.  The =noty-setup-wiki= command will
copy this skeleton into the target directory.
