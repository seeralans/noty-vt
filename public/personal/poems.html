Unlike me yesterday
</p>

<p>
I woke up well today.
Woke up with hope today.
So I’ll work hard today,
Unlike me yesterday.
</p>

<p>
I drank brew well today.
Read my news feed today.
Said just one feed today
Unlike me yesterday.
</p>

<p>
I ate lunch well today.
Watched a short clip today.
Said just one clip today
Unlike me yesterday.
</p>

<p>
I ate tea well today.
Watched my sweet show today.
Said just one show today
Unlike me yesterday.
</p>

<p>
I told my lie today,
Said I’ll work hard today.
But I just lost my day,
Just like me yesterday.

<h2 id="org7131361"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> First love</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
My love
How strong you look, yet fragile.
Though you shaped so many,
You never sought acclaim.
But now, many loathe you,
And many more neglect you.
</p>

<p>
Yet I still love.
For if I love you only at your brightest,
Did I truly love at all?
I will not abandon you,
for you are my home,
my sanctuary,
my Britain.
