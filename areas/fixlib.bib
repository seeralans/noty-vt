  abstract = {The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents' spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96\% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically.},

  abstract = {We study diffusion--reaction processes on periodic simple cubic (sc) lattices and square planar lattices. We consider a single diffusing reactant undergoing an irreversible reaction upon first encounter with a static co-reactant placed at a given site (``one-walker problem''). We also allow for a competing reaction, namely, instantaneous trapping of the diffusing reactant at any other site (with probability s) before interacting with the static co-reactant. We use a generating function approach and Markov theory, as well as MC simulations, to determine the mean walklength \textlangle n\textrangle{} of the diffusing reactant before either of the two competing reactions takes place. To investigate the dependence of \textlangle n\textrangle{} on lattice size we compute the first, finite size corrections to the Green function of the sc lattice, correcting results reported in the literature. Using these results, space exploration properties and first-passage properties (e.g. walklength statistics, mean number of distinct sites visited, statistics of return to the origin, etc.) of both conventional (immortal) walks and mortal walks can be determined. In this context, we develop a novel approach based on a two-point Pad\'e approximant for the Green function. Finally, we study by means of MC simulations the more complex case where both reactant and co-reactant undergo synchronous nearest-neighbor displacements (``two-walker problem''). Here, we assume that reactant and co-reactant can individually be trapped with probability s at any lattice site, or can undergo an irreversible reaction on first encounter at any site. When s=0 we find that, both for the one-walker and the two-walker problem, for lattices with (approximately) the same number of sites, the mean walklength is smaller (and hence the reaction efficiency greater) in d=3 than in d=2. Increasing s tends to reduce differences in system dimensionality, and distinctions between the one-walker problem and the two-walker problem. Our model provides a good starting point to develop studies on the efficiency of apparently diverse diffusion--reaction processes, such as diffusion on a partially poisoned catalytic substrate or photosynthetic trapping of excitations.},

Hence, numerical transform inversion can be an effective way to obtain desired numerical values of cumulative distribution functions, probability density functions and probability mass functions. However, numerical transform inversion has not been widely used. This lack of use seems to be due, at least in part, to good simple numerical inversion algorithms not being well known. To help remedy this situation, in this paper we present a version of the Fourier-series method for numerically inverting probability generating functions. We obtain a simple algorithm with a convenient error bound from the discrete Poision summation formula. The same general approach applies to other transforms.},

We characterize the walks and the use of resources in several statistical ways, involving the behavior of the average used fraction of the system, the length of the cycles followed by the walkers, and the frequency of visits to plants. Preliminary results on population effects are explored by means of a system of two non directly interacting animals. Properties of the overlap of home ranges show the existence of a set of parameters that provides the best utilization of the shared resource.},

  abstract = {Although various drugs, environmental pollutants and nanoparticles (NP) can cross the human placental barrier and may harm the developing fetus, knowledge on predictive placental transfer rates and the underlying transport pathways is mostly lacking. Current available in vitro placental transfer models are often inappropriate for translocation studies of macromolecules or NPs and do not consider barrier function of placental endothelial cells (EC). Therefore, we developed a human placental in vitro co-culture transfer model with tight layers of trophoblasts (BeWo b30) and placental microvascular ECs (HPEC-A2) on a low-absorbing, 3\,\textmu m porous membrane. Translocation studies with four model substances and two polystyrene (PS) NPs across the individual and co-culture layers revealed that for most of these compounds, the trophoblast and the EC layer both demonstrate similar, but not additive, retention capacity. Only the paracellular marker Na-F was substantially more retained by the BeWo layer. Furthermore, simple shaking, which is often applied to mimic placental perfusion, did not alter translocation kinetics compared to static exposure. In conclusion, we developed a novel placental co-culture model, which provides predictive values for translocation of a broad variety of molecules and NPs and enables valuable mechanistic investigations on cell type-specific placental barrier function.},

It can be regarded as a generalization of the noisy voter model in which agents update their binary states by copying others and by an intrinsic mechanism affected by the degree of polarization in the system. It also takes into account whether the agents enhance or reduce their intrinsic mechanism upon increasing polarization. Four phases or shapes of the steadystate probability of a fraction of agents in a given state are found (unimodal, bimodal, W and M). In the unimodal (resp. bimodal) phase, the copying (resp. intrinsic) mechanism is globally dominant, while in the W (resp. M) phase the copying (resp. intrinsic) mechanism is the relevant one close to the consensus states while it reduces its influence as approaching coexistence. In the thermodynamic limit, the bimodal and W phases disappear, while the unimodal and M phases prevail.

In animal cells, the geometry, density and directionality of microtubule networks are major determinants of cellular architecture, polarity and proliferation. In dividing cells, microtubules form bipolar spindles that pull chromosomes apart, whereas in interphase cells, microtubules are organized in a cell type-specific fashion, which strongly correlates with cell physiology. In motile cells, such as fibroblasts and immune cells, microtubules are organized as radial asters, whereas in immotile epithelial and neuronal cells and in muscles, microtubules form parallel or antiparallel arrays and cortical meshworks. Here, we review recent work addressing how the formation of such microtubule networks is driven by the plethora of microtubule regulatory proteins. These include proteins that nucleate or anchor microtubule ends at different cellular structures and those that sever or move microtubules, as well as regulators of microtubule elongation, stability, bundling or modifications. The emerging picture, although still very incomplete, shows a remarkable diversity of cell-specific mechanisms that employ conserved building blocks to adjust microtubule organization in order to facilitate different cellular functions.},

This accumulation can be enhanced by electrostatic interactions between positively charged protein domains and the negatively charged microtubule lattice.+TIPs form extensive interaction networks, which depend on a limited number of protein motifs and modules that bind to each other with moderate affinity, allowing rapid remodelling of the end-associated complexes during microtubule growth and shortening. The recruitment of proteins with SxIP and cytoskeleton-associated protein Gly-rich (CAP-Gly) domains by the 'autonomous' +TIPs of the end-binding protein (EB) family plays a major part in the formation of these networks.+TIP networks are responsible for a large range of cellular functions, such as microtubule guidance along other cytoskeletal elements, microtubule attachment to the cell cortex, kinetochores and intracellular membrane organelles, positioning of microtubule arrays and signalling.Microtubule minus-end-targeting proteins (-TIPs) of the calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein (CAMSAP) and Patronin family accumulate at free, growing microtubule minus ends and control the architecture of microtubule networks by stabilizing non-centrosomal microtubules.A wide range of diverse pharmacological agents can target microtubule tips either directly or indirectly and cooperate with +TIPs in regulating the dynamics of microtubule ends.},

Our model contains two states, a low entropy/high affinity ordered state and a high entropy/low affinity disordered state. Consistent with experiments, our model shows a diffusion-limited linear growth regime at low concentration, followed by a concentration independent plateau at intermediate concentrations, and rapid disordered precipitation at the highest concentrations. We show that growth in the linear and plateau regions is the result of two processes that compete amid the rapid binding and unbinding of non-specific states. The first process is the addition of ordered molecules during the periods where the end of the filament is free of incorrectly bound molecules. The second process is the capture of defects, which occurs when consecutive ordered additions occur on top of incorrectly bound molecules. We show that a key molecular property is the probability that a diffusive collision results in a correctly bound state. Small values of this probability suppress the defect capture growth mode, resulting in a plateau in the growth rate when incorrectly bound molecules become common enough to poison ordered growth. We show that conditions that non-specifically suppress or enhance intermolecular interactions, such as the addition of depletants or osmolytes, have opposite effects on the growth rate in the linear and plateau regimes. In the linear regime stronger interactions promote growth by reducing dissolution events, but in the plateau regime stronger interactions inhibit growth by stabilizing incorrectly bound molecules.},

For these processes we focus attention on the First Passage Time from a barrier and on the First Exit Time from a region delimited by two barriers.

We then review the physical models that have been developed to explain how these interactions give rise to collective cellular movement. These models span the subcellular to the supracellular scales, and they include lattice models, phase-field models, active network models, particle models, and continuum models. For each type of model, we discuss its formulation, its limitations, and the main emergent phenomena that it has successfully explained. These phenomena include flocking and fluid--solid transitions, as well as wetting, fingering, and mechanical waves in spreading epithelial monolayers. We close by outlining remaining challenges and future directions in the physics of collective cell migration.},

This problem can be mapped onto a variety of physical problems, including one-dimensional particle or excitation diffusion with random spatial transfer rates or random trap depths, low-temperature properties of the random one-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet, one-dimensional tight-binding fermion systems with correlated diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, and electrical lines of random conductances or capacitances. Replacing dPndt by d2Pndt2, the above equations also describe a harmonic chain with random force constants or random masses. Both the random W and the random C problem are shown to reduce to the same mathematical problem, and the authors review the derivation and consequences of its exact asymptotic solution for some general classes of probability densities. In particular, they are able to determine the exact {$\omega\rightarrow$}0 asymptotic behavior of the single-site Green function, and thus the low-energy density of states and (for diffusion-type problems) the long-time behavior of the autocorrelation function. For diffusion-type problems, the investigators further introduce a scaling hypothesis (based on the assumption of the existence of a single characteristic length) for the time dependence of the excitation amplitude at sites other than the initially excited site. This allows the calculation of the low-frequency diffusion constant, and with the help of the Einstein relation, the low-frequency conductivity. The authors apply their results to several physical systems and, in particular, are able to account quantitatively for the complex low-frequency conductivity of the one-dimensional superionic conductor hollandite. The results may also be relevant to quasi-one-dimensional electronic systems for times (or frequencies) such that diffusion is restricted to a single dimension. The expansion of an earlier scaling approach gives additional insight into the physical meaning of the asymptotic solutions. The researchers further discuss effective-medium-type approximations, which, apart from a numerical prefactor, lead to the correct asymptotic dependences. Comparison is made with the results of alternative approaches to this type of problem, specifically with those of the continuous time random walk. The authors exhibit the remarkable satisfaction of the hyperscaling relations for the specific heat and correlation function critical exponents for the random Heisenberg ferromagnet, even though the exponents themselves are not universal. Finally, aspects of the problem which remain unsolved, or which are only partly resolved, are discussed. These include the derivation of asymptotic expansions beyond the leading term, the derivation of rigorous asymptotic expressions for the conductivity, the calculation of fluctuations in the site occupancy probabilities for the diffusion problem, and the treatment of the random one-dimensional antiferromagnet and random one-dimensional xy model. The investigators close with a short description of an application of this work to electronic conduction in highly anisotropic materials.},

  abstract = {We present a mechanical model of tissue homeostasis that is specialised to the intestinal crypt. Growth and deformation of the crypt, idealised as a line of cells on a substrate, are modelled using morphoelastic rod theory. Alternating between Lagrangian and Eulerian mechanical descriptions enables us to precisely characterise the dynamic nature of tissue homeostasis, whereby the proliferative structure and morphology are static in the Eulerian frame, but there is active migration of Lagrangian material points out of the crypt. Assuming mechanochemical growth, we identify the necessary conditions for homeostasis, reducing the full, time-dependent system to a static boundary value problem characterising a spatially heterogeneous ``treadmilling'' state. We extract essential features of crypt homeostasis, such as the morphology, the proliferative structure, the migration velocity, and the sloughing rate. We also derive closed-form solutions for growth and sloughing dynamics in homeostasis, and show that mechanochemical growth is sufficient to generate the observed proliferative structure of the crypt. Key to this is the concept of threshold-dependent mechanical feedback, that regulates an established Wnt signal for biochemical growth. Numerical solutions demonstrate the importance of crypt morphology on homeostatic growth, migration, and sloughing, and highlight the value of this framework as a foundation for studying the role of mechanics in homeostasis.},

The surface of the bacterium is visualized with unprecedented detail at 50 and 5 \AA{} lateral and vertical resolutions, respectively. The AFM images reveal that the outer membrane of native E. coli exhibits protrusions that correspond to patches of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) containing hundreds to thousands of LPS molecules. The packing of the nearest neighbor patches is tight, and as such the LPS layer provides an effective permeability barrier for the Gram-negative bacteria. Treatment with 50 mM EDTA results in the release of LPS molecules from the boundaries of some patches. Further metal depletion produces many irregularly shaped pits at the outer membrane, which is the consequence of progressive release of LPS molecules and membrane proteins. The EDTA-treated cells were analyzed for metal content and for their reactivities toward lysozyme and antibodies specific for LPS. The experiments collectively indicate that the metal depletion procedure did not remove all the LPS molecules despite a dramatic decrease in the metal content. The remaining LPS molecules are present outside the pits, whereas the bottom of the pits is devoid of these molecules. This new structure for the outer membrane exhibits higher permeability than that for the native cells.},

Hostile landscape features can inhibit animal movement (i.e., genetic exchange), while other landscape attributes facilitate gene flow. The genetic attributes of organisms inhabiting such complex environments can reveal the legacy of their movements through the landscape. Thus, by evaluating landscape attributes within the context of genetic connectivity of organisms within the landscape, we can elucidate how a species has coped with the enhanced complexity of human altered environments. In this research, we utilized genetic data from eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) in conjunction with spatially explicit habitat attribute data to evaluate the realized permeability of various landscape elements in a fragmented agricultural ecosystem. To accomplish this we 1) used logistic regression to evaluate whether land cover attributes were most often associated with the matrix between or habitat within genetically identified populations across the landscape, and 2) utilized spatially explicit habitat attribute data to predict genetically-derived Bayesian probabilities of population membership of individual chipmunks in an agricultural ecosystem. Consistency between the results of the two approaches with regard to facilitators and inhibitors of gene flow in the landscape indicate that this is a promising new way to utilize both landscape and genetic data to gain a deeper understanding of human-altered ecosystems.},

  abstract = {To determine the extent to which heat conduction through skin is affected by skin thickness, burn temperature, and burn duration, we perform a suite of experiments using an in vivo porcine (pig) model. Fourteen different burn conditions are considered, and each burn condition is replicated at least four times, giving a total of sixty four individual experimental burns. The subdermal temperature within the skin is recorded as a function of time during each experiment. To quantitatively interpret the experimental data, we develop an exact solution of a simplified, depth-averaged, heat equation. Calibrating this solution to the experimental data provide estimates of the effective thermal diffusivity of the skin, {$\alpha$}, and the effective thermal loss rate, k. Estimates of {$\alpha$} and k are obtained for the fourteen different, clinically relevant, burn conditions. Overall, we find {$\alpha$}=0.03\textpm 0.02mm2/s (to one significant figure), and is approximately independent of the burn duration, burn temperature, and skin thickness (H). This estimate implies that the time required for thermal energy to diffuse vertically down, through the skin of thicker (H=2.27mm) and thinner (H=1.40mm) skinned animals is approximately 170 and 70s, respectively. We find that k=0.002\textpm 0.002/s (to one significant figure). In summary, our results provide contemporary estimates for the thermal properties of in vivo porcine skin, which has broad application to heat transfer modelling investigations of thermal injury prevention and thermal therapy studies.},

  abstract = {The most critical factor for increasing crop production is the successful resistance of pests and pathogens which has massive impacts on global food security. Therefore, Filippov systems have been used to model and grasp control strategies for limited resources in Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Extensive studies have been done on these systems where the evolution is governed by a smooth set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). As far as we know the time delay has not been considered in these systems, which we mean that a set of delay differential equations (DDEs). With this motivation, a Filippov prey--predator (pest--natural enemy) model with time delay is introduced in this paper, where the time delay represents the change of growth rate of the natural enemy before releasing it to feed on pests. The threshold conditions for the stability of the equilibria are derived by using time delay as a bifurcation parameter. It is shown that when the time delay parameter passes through some critical values, a periodic oscillation phenomenon appears through Hopf bifurcation. Further, by employing Filippov convex method we obtain the equation of sliding motion and address the sliding mode dynamics. Numerically, we demonstrate that the time delay plays a substantial role in discontinuity-induced bifurcation. More precisely, one can get boundary focus bifurcation from boundary node bifurcation through variation of the value of the time delay. Moreover, the time delay is used as a bifurcation parameter to obtain sliding--switching and sliding--grazing bifurcations. In conclusion, a Filippov system with time delay can give new insights into pest control models.},

  abstract = {We develop a method for calculating energy migration in random heterogeneous aggregates, with potential application to the primary process in photosynthetic units. A Monte Carlo technique is employed to study several types of random walk motion in a random binary lattice. Our computations include 2 and 3 dimensional lattices of different topology and employ correlated steps with a Gaussian distribution of directional memory. The effects of the characteristics of the motion and its parameters are displayed and discussed. The lower threshold for efficient visitation by the walker is given by the critical percolation concentration. However, a higher threshold is found in the case of coherent motion. This new ``turning point'' appears to play an important role in the process of exciton transport. The exciton percolation formalism is utilized, giving results for ternary random lattices where the third component is very dilute and acts as a sensor. The results are applied to a system representing the 11B2u, naphthalene exciton dynamics in an isotopic and chemically mixed crystal, which by itself is supposed to mimic the exciton transport in the photosynthetic units of green plants. Physically reasonable parameters, trends and limits are discussed. Also, an analytical solution is derived and tested for a physically reasonable limit of semicoherent motion in a perfect lattice. The ramification of this work on bioexciton transfer is discussed, especially concerning the light harvesting units in green plants. It leads to a simple minded model that rationalized the ratio of antenna to active-center molecules. Our most important result is that incoherent exciton transfer, i.e. simple random walk, is the most efficient process for significantly heterogeneous aggregates.},

Despite many existing theories and studies on the fundamental motivations of the behavior of humans in financial systems, there is still limited empirical deduction of the behavioral compositions of the financial agents from a detailed market analysis. Blockchain technology has provided an avenue for the latter investigation with its voluminous data and its transparency of financial transactions. It has enabled us to perform empirical inference on the behavioral patterns of users in the market, which we explore in the bitcoin and ethereum cryptocurrency markets. In our study, we first determine various properties of the bitcoin and ethereum users by a temporal complex network analysis. After which, we develop methodology by combining k-means clustering and Support Vector Machines to derive behavioral types of users in the two cryptocurrency markets. Interestingly, we found four distinct strategies that are common in both markets: optimists, pessimists, positive traders and negative traders. The composition of user behavior is remarkably different between the bitcoin and ethereum market during periods of local price fluctuations and large systemic events. We observe that bitcoin (ethereum) users tend to take a short-term (long-term) view of the market during the local events. For the large systemic events, ethereum (bitcoin) users are found to consistently display a greater sense of pessimism (optimism) towards the future of the market.},

These span a broad range of scales: from intra-cellular populations of molecules to population of cells and then to groups of plants, animals and people. Large deviations in stochastic population dynamics---such as those determining population extinction, fixation or switching between different states---are presently in a focus of attention of statistical physicists. We review recent progress in applying different variants of dissipative WKB approximation (after Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin) to this class of problems. The WKB approximation allows one to evaluate the mean time and/ or probability of population extinction, fixation and switches resulting from either intrinsic (demographic) noise, or a combination of the demographic noise and environmental variations, deterministic or random. We mostly cover well-mixed populations, single and multiple, but also briefly consider populations on heterogeneous networks and spatial populations. The spatial setting also allows one to study large fluctuations of the speed of biological invasions. Finally, we briefly discuss possible directions of future work.},

Road permeability is not homogeneous, and animals perceive traffic and road structures differently. There is a lack of information about how species behave when they face a road. Expert knowledge is an alternative source of information when empirical data are not available. We propose the Road Permeability Index (RPI) as a formal method to incorporate expert knowledge into quantitative assessments of road permeability. We used a multi-taxon, expert-based approach that combines landscape structure and road infrastructure effects on fauna throughout landscapes. All codes are in R language, which are freely available at a GitHub repository. As a study case, we applied the RPI to 28 sampling sites along two highways in the north of S\~ao Paulo Metropolitan Region-Brazil. We used expert knowledge information on five taxa: primates, bats, medium- and large-sized terrestrial mammals, birds, and amphibians. We also propose a method to rank taxa according to their relative contribution to RPI, which enables prioritization in environmental impact assessments related to roads. For our study case, landscape and road attributes were both important for predicting road permeability, though landscape variables showed a slightly stronger average influence. RPI constitutes a replicable and easily adaptable alternative to evaluate road permeability, particularly in the absence of empirical data. RPI outcomes can inform road impact mitigation strategies and location.},

  abstract = {Proteins and other macromolecules can act as molecular machines that convert energy from one form to another through cycles of conformational transitions. In a macroscopically fluctuating environment or at the single-molecule level, the probability for a molecule to be in any state j fluctuates, and the probability current from any other state i to state j is given as the sum of a steady-state current and a pumped current, Iij=Issij+FijdPj/dt, where Fij is the fraction of the fluctuating current into and out of state j coming directly from state i, and dPj/dt is the rate of change of the probability for the molecule to be in state j. If the fluctuations arise from an equilibrium source, microscopic reversibility guarantees that the time average of the pumped current is zero. If, however, the fluctuations arise due to the action of a nonequilibrium source, the time average of the pumped current is not in general zero and can be opposite in sign to the steady-state current. The pumped current provides a mechanism by which fluctuations, whether generated externally or arising from an internal nonequilibrium chemical reaction, can do electrical, mechanical, or chemical work on a system by coupling into the equilibrium conformational transitions of a protein. In this review I examine work elaborating the mechanism of stochastic pumping and also discuss a thermodynamically consistent approach for modeling the effects of dynamic disorder on enzymes and other proteins.},

In ecology, such research has often focused on the development of two movement models: (i) the L\'evy walk and (ii) the composite correlated random walk and its associated area-restricted search behaviour. Although the processes underlying these models differ, they can produce similar movement patterns. Due to this similarity and because of their disparate formulation, current methods cannot reliably differentiate between these two models. Here, we present a method that differentiates between the two models. It consists of likelihood functions, including one for a hidden Markov model, and associated statistical measures that assess the relative support for and absolute fit of each model. Using a simulation study, we show that our method can differentiate between the two search models over a range of parameter values. Using the movement data of two polar bears (Ursus maritimus), we show that the method can be applied to complex, real-world movement paths. By providing the means to differentiate between the two most prominent search models in the literature, and a framework that could be extended to include other models, we facilitate further research into the strategies animals use to find resources.},

These proposals include searching, routing, self-stabilization, and query processing in wireless networks, peer-to-peer networks and other distributed systems. This approach is gaining popularity because random walks present locality, simplicity, low-overhead and inherent robustness to structural changes. In this work we propose and investigate an enhanced algorithm that we refer to as random walks with choice. In this algorithm, instead of selecting just one neighbor at each step, the walk moves to the next node after examining a small number of neighbors sampled at random. Our empirical results on random geometric graphs, the model best suited for wireless networks, suggest a significant improvement in important metrics such as energy consumption and the cover time and load-balancing properties of random walks. We also systematically investigate random walks with choice on networks with a square grid topology. For this case, our simulations indicate that there is an unbounded improvement in cover time even with a choice of only two neighbors. We also observe a large reduction in the variance of the cover time, and a significant improvement in visit load balancing.},

  abstract = {Defect engineering in photocatalytic materials has been proven as a versatile approach to maneuver their performance in solar-to-chemical energy conversion. In this article, the state-of-the-art progress on the defect-engineered photocatalytic materials is reviewed. We first give the critical classifications for defects in photocatalysts. Then various strategies for fabricating defects in photocatalytic materials are summarized together with their characterization techniques. As a focus, the promotion of three basic steps in photocatalysis, including light absorption, charge transfer and separation, and surface catalytic reaction by defect engineering is discussed in detail. Moreover, some other important functions of defects in photocatalysis are introduced in the article, followed by the discussion on some recent advancements of defective photocatalytic materials in energy-related applications. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges regarding defect engineering in photocatalysis are presented to highlight the development directions of this research field.},

  abstract = {Actomyosin machinery endows cells with contractility at a single-cell level. However, within a monolayer, cells can be contractile or extensile based on the direction of pushing or pulling forces exerted by their neighbours or on the substrate. It has been shown that a monolayer of fibroblasts behaves as a contractile system while epithelial or neural progentior monolayers behave as an extensile system. Through a combination of cell culture experiments and in silico modelling, we reveal the mechanism behind this switch in extensile to contractile as the weakening of intercellular contacts. This switch promotes the build-up of tension at the cell--substrate interface through an increase in actin stress fibres and traction forces. This is accompanied by mechanotransductive changes in vinculin and YAP activation. We further show that contractile and extensile differences in cell activity sort cells in mixtures, uncovering a generic mechanism for pattern formation during cell competition, and morphogenesis.},

In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the second paper we used the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, namely, \textbar{$\Lambda\beta\vert$} = e\texttheta{$\beta$} with ∆ {$<$} \texttheta{} {$<$} 2∆ - U . In the present paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, \textbar{$\Lambda\beta\vert$} = e{$\Theta\beta$} with ∆ {$<$} {$\Theta$} {$<$} {$\Gamma$} - (2∆ - U ), where {$\Gamma$} is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time and the tube of typical trajectories towards nucleation. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation. One of the key ingredients in the proof is an estimate showing that no information can travel between these boxes on relevant time scales. Prior to nucleation, the dynamics inside the moderately large boxes spends most of its time in configurations consisting of a single quasisquare surrounded by free particles, and makes transitions between these configurations at rates that depend on the linear sizes of the quasi-square in a computable manner.},

Previous results have shown how the entropy production provides information about irreversibility and criticality. Mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations were used in the analysis. The results obtained here show a continuous phase transition, reflected in the entropy production as a logarithmic divergence of its derivative, which suggests a shared universality class with the irreversible models invariant under the symmetry operations of the Ising model.},

However, exponential decays of the positional probability density function P(X,t) of packets of spreading random walkers, were observed in numerous situations that include glasses, live cells, and bacteria suspensions. We show that such exponential behavior is generally valid in a large class of problems of transport in random media. By extending the large deviations approach for a continuous time random walk, we uncover a general universal behavior for the decay of the density. It is found that fluctuations in the number of steps of the random walker, performed at finite time, lead to exponential decay (with logarithmic corrections) of P(X,t). This universal behavior also holds for short times, a fact that makes experimental observations readily achievable.},

Over the past decade, much has been learned about the molecular functions of these proteins, where they act in the cell, and what physiological roles they play during plant growth and development. A typical PPR protein is targeted to mitochondria or chloroplasts, binds one or several organellar transcripts, and influences their expression by altering RNA sequence, turnover, processing, or translation. Their combined action has profound effects on organelle biogenesis and function and, consequently, on photosynthesis, respiration, plant development, and environmental responses. Recent breakthroughs in understanding how PPR proteins recognize RNA sequences through modular base-specific contacts will help match proteins to potential binding sites and provide a pathway toward designing synthetic RNA-binding proteins aimed at desired targets.},

A high bending flexibility is needed in the crowded cytoplasm where tubes often need to bend significantly in the axial direction at sub-micron length scales. We find the stiffness of spontaneously formed membrane nanotubes by measuring the persistence length of reconstituted membrane nanotubes freely suspended in solution and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. By quantifying the tube diameter we demonstrate for the first time that the persistence length scales linearly with radius. Although most tubes are uni-lamellar, the predicted linear scaling between tube radius and persistence length allows us to identify tubes that spontaneously form as multilamellar structures upon hydration. We provide the first experimental evidence that illumination of lipid fluorophores can have a profound effect on the lipid bilayer which we sensitively detect as a continuous change in the tube persistence length with time. The novel assay and methodology here presented has potential for quantification of the structural reinforcement of membrane tubes by scaffolding proteins.},

  abstract = {Searching individuals need to take decisions on where and how long to search. When food is spatially aggregated, detection of a food item signals a probability for the presence of further prey items in its surrounding. Organisms can thus intensify search effort upon detecting a prey item, but after unsuccessfully searching for a while, return to the previous, extensive search, this strategy is known as 'area-concentrated-search' (ACS). Here we present results of simulations where individuals perform ACS employing a correlated random walk with variable directional persistence. Switching between intensive and extensive search (with respectively low and high directional persistence) is a function of searcher's internal state represented as 'satiety' level depending on preceding consumption of prey items.We explore the effect of this function's control parameters ('switching level' i.e., the satiety at which the switching occurs, and the switchover shape parameter) on searching efficiency in dependence of (1) prey items' spatial distribution ranging from randomly uniform to highly contagious, (2) the overall prey density, and (3) prey 'caloric' value.Our main conclusions: (1) the form of the adopted switchover exerts an effect on searching efficiency, and this effect is most pronounced in landscapes with highly aggregated resources. Except for the most homogeneous prey distributions, there was a clear optimum area within the movement parameter space, yielding highest efficiency. (2) The optimal switching level is larger in heterogeneous landscapes, but optimum switchover shape is little affected by any of the landscape attributes. In most landscapes, it is most profitable to switch gradually rather than abruptly. (3) The success and optimal switching level depend not only on the prey's spatial distribution but also on average prey density while the value of prey items has little effect on the optimal movement parameters. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The recent debate on both the existence and the cause of fractal (Le \textasciiacute vy) patterns in animal movement resonates with much deeper and richer problems in movement ecology: (1) establishing mechanistic links between animal behavior and statistical patterns of movement, and (2) understanding what is the role of randomness (stochasticity) in animal motion. Here, the idea of behavioral intermittence is shown to be crucial to establish mechanistic connections between the behavior of organisms and the statistical properties they generate when moving. Attention is drawn to the fact that some random walk modeling procedures can impair the identification of intermittent biological mechanisms which could govern major statistical properties of movement. This fact, together with some misconceptions and prejudices regarding the role of randomness in animal motion may explain why stochastic processes have been disregarded as a potential source of adaptation in animal movement. In the near future, the advances in biotelemetry together with a more explicit consideration of behavioral intermittence, and the development of novel random walk approaches, could help us to set up the bases for a landscape-level behavioral ecology.}

  abstract = {Random walk methods and diffusion theory pervaded ecological sciences as methods to analyze and describe animal movement. Consequently, statistical physics was mostly seen as a toolbox rather than as a conceptual framework that could contribute to theory on evolutionary biology and ecology. However, the existence of mechanistic relationships and feedbacks between behavioral processes and statistical patterns of movement suggests that, beyond movement quantification, statistical physics may prove to be an adequate framework to understand animal behavior across scales from an ecological and evolutionary perspective. Recently developed random search theory has served to critically re-evaluate classic ecological questions on animal foraging. For instance, during the last few years, there has been a growing debate on whether search behavior can include traits that improve success by optimizing random (stochastic) searches. Here, we stress the need to bring together the general encounter problem within foraging theory, as a mean for making progress in the biological understanding of random searching. By sketching the assumptions of optimal foraging theory (OFT) and by summarizing recent results on random search strategies, we pinpoint ways to extend classic OFT, and integrate the study of search strategies and its main results into the more general theory of optimal foraging.},

  abstract = {Animal searches cover a full range of possibilities from highly deterministic to apparently completely random behaviors. However, even those stochastic components of animal movement can be adaptive, since not all random distributions lead to similar success in finding targets. Here we address the general problem of optimizing encounter rates in non-deterministic, non-oriented searches, both in homogeneous and patchy target landscapes. Specifically, we investigate how two different features related to turning angle distributions influence encounter success: (i) the shape (relative kurtosis) of the angular distribution and (ii) the correlations between successive relative orientations (directional memory). Such influence is analyzed in correlated random walk models using a proper choice of representative turning angle distributions of the recently proposed Jones and Pewsey class. We consider the cases of distributions with nearly the same shape but considerably distinct correlation lengths, and distributions with same correlation but with contrasting relative kurtosis. In homogeneous landscapes, we find that the correlation length has a large influence in the search efficiency. Moreover, similar search efficiencies can be reached by means of distinctly shaped turning angle distributions, provided that the resulting correlation length is the same. In contrast, in patchy landscapes the particular shape of the distribution also becomes relevant for the search efficiency, specially at high target densities. Excessively sharp distributions generate very inefficient searches in landscapes where local target density fluctuations are large. These results are of evolutionary interest. On the one hand, it is shown that equally successful directional memory can arise from contrasting turning behaviors, therefore increasing the likelihood of robust adaptive stochastic behavior. On the other hand, when target landscape is patchy, adequate tumbling may help to explore better local scale heterogeneities, being some details of the shape of the distribution also potentially adaptive. \copyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The web-spinning sawflies of the genus Cephalcia Panzer (Hymenoptera, Pamphiliidae) are usually monitored by sampling prepupae in soil and by catching adults with visual traps, including yellow sticky traps. However, adult catches have never been compared with the actual density of prepupae. In this paper, a relationship is presented between the catches of Cephalcia arvensis Panzer adults (mostly males) and the number of prepupae ready to emerge (pronymphs) in an outbreak area of spruce forest (Picea abies Karsten) in the Southern Alps (Asiago, Italy). A significant linear relationship between the logarithmic estimates of the two variables was found. The model includes a spatial autoregressive parameter because adult catches were spatially correlated. The relationship allows to know whether or not the defoliation threshold of 20 pronymphs/m2 in spring samples is being exceeded, based on the number of adults caught on yellow sticky traps (defoliation threshold of 14.26 adults/trap). The variance not explained by the model is probably due to the flight behaviour of adult males, to the low precision of the estimated pronymph density at low population levels, and to the attraction of males by few females that are trapped and remain alive. The model was validated in a large monitoring programme of undamaged alpine spruce forests and allowed detection of two newly infested stands out of six that were considered at risk of defoliation, because of adult catch exceeded the threshold. Low adult catches were always associated with absence of defoliation. Our conclusion is that trapping of adult sawflies is a cheaper and easier monitoring method than prepupae sampling in the soil. This makes earlier detection of outbreaks possible, and consequently more efficient control.},

Brownian random walks, and diffusive flux as their mean field counterpart, provide one framework in which to consider this problem. However, it remains subject to debate and controversy. This study presents a test of the diffusion framework using movement data obtained from controlled experiments. * Walking beetles (Tenebrio molitor) were released in an open circular arena with a central hole and the number of individuals falling from the arena edges was monitored over time. These boundary counts were compared, using curve fitting, to the predictions of a diffusion model. The diffusion model is solved precisely, without using numerical simulations. * We find that the shape of the curves derived from the diffusion model is a close match to those found experimentally. Furthermore, in general, estimates of the total population obtained from the relevant solution of the diffusion equation are in excellent agreement with the experimental population. Estimates of the dispersal rate of individuals depend on how accurately the initial release distribution is incorporated into the model. * We therefore show that diffusive flux is a very good approximation to the movement of a population of Tenebrio molitor beetles. As such, we suggest that it is an adequate theoretical/modelling framework for ecological studies that account for insect movement, although it can be context specific. An immediate practical application of this can be found in the interpretation of trap counts, in particular for the purpose of pest monitoring.},

They have been claimed to be more efficient than the "classical" random walks, and they also seem able to account for the actual search patterns of various species. This suggests that many animals may move using a LW process. LW patterns look like the actual search patterns displayed by animals foraging in a patchy environment, where extensive and intensive searching modes alternate, and which can be generated by a mixture of classical random walks. In this context, even elementary composite Brownian walks are more efficient than LW but may be confounded with them because they present apparent move-length-heavy tail distributions and superdiffusivity. The move-length "survival" distribution (i.e., the cumulative number of moves greater than any given threshold) appears to be a better means to highlight a LW pattern. Even once such a pattern has been clearly identified, it remains to determine how it was actually generated, because a LW pattern is not necessarily produced by a LW process but may emerge from the way the animal interacted with the environment structure through more classical movement processes. In any case, emergent movement patterns should not be confused with the processes that gave rise to them.},

This model represents an idealized description for the fate of an unaware forager whose motion is not affected by the presence or absence of resources.

In the exactly solvable case of one dimension, we explicitly derive the average lifetime of the walk and the distribution for the number of distinct sites visited by the walk at the instant of starvation. We also give a heuristic derivation for the averages of these two quantities. We tackle the complex but ecologically relevant case of two dimensions by an approximation in which the depleted zone is assumed to always be circular and which grows incrementally each time the walk reaches the edge of this zone. Within this framework, we derive a lower bound for the scaling of the average lifetime and number of distinct sites visited at starvation. We also determine the asymptotic distribution of the number of distinct sites visited at starvation. Finally, we solve the case of high spatial dimensions within a mean-field approach.},

In addition, we have performed computer simulations of the same model and shown that while the CPA with a constant correlation parameter cannot describe the global behaviour of the model, a reasonable description of the endemic equilibria as well as of the phase diagram may be obtained by allowing the parameter to depend on the demographic rate.},

Due to their indefiniteness and often poor spectral properties, such linear systems represent a significant challenge for solver developers.

  abstract = {Movement is a primary mechanism coupling animals to their environment, yet there exists little em- pirical analysis to test our theoretical knowledge of this basic process. We used correlated random walk (CRW) models and satellite telemetry to investigate long- distance movements of caribou, the most vagile, non- volant terrestrial vertebrate in the world. Individual paths of migratory and sedentary female caribou were quantified using measures of mean move length and angle, and net squared displacements at each successive move were com- pared to predictions from the models. Movements were modelled at two temporal scales. For paths recorded through one annual cycle, the CRW model overpredicted net displacement of caribou through time. For paths re- corded over shorter intervals delineated by seasonal behav- ioural changes of caribou, there was excellent correspon- dence between model predictions and observations for most periods for both migratory and sedentary caribou. On the smallest temporal scale, a CRW model significantly overpredicted displacements of migratory caribou during 3 months following calving; this was also the case for seden- tary caribou in late summer, and in late winter. In all cases of overprediction there was significant positive autocorre- lation in turn direction, indicating that movements were more tortuous than expected. In one case of underpredic- tion, significant negative autocorrelation of sequential turn direction was evident, indicating that migratory caribou moved in straightened paths during spring migration to calving grounds. Results are discussed in light of known migration patterns and possible limiting factors for cari- bou, and indicate the applicability of CRW models to ani- mal movement at vast spatial and temporal scales, thus as- sisting in future development of more sophisticated models of population spread and redistribution for vertebrates.},

Past researchers have proposed homogenizing the surface boundary conditions, replacing the reflecting (Neumann) and absorbing (Dirichlet) boundary conditions with a mixed (Robin) boundary condition. We extend previous work to asymptotically determine the leakage parameter for the mixed boundary condition for arbitrary periodic pore configurations in the dilute fraction limit. In this asymptotic limit, we pose and solve an optimization problem for the Bravais lattice which maximizes the capture rate of the absorbing pores, finding the hexagonal lattice to be the global maximum.},

  abstract = {Impediments to animal movement are ubiquitous and vary widely in both scale and permeability. It is essential to understand how impediments alter ecological dynamics via their influence on animal behavioural strategies governing space use and, for anthropogenic features such as roads and fences, how to mitigate these effects to effectively manage species and landscapes. Here, we focused primarily on barriers to movement, which we define as features that cannot be circumnavigated but may be crossed. Responses to barriers will be influenced by the movement capabilities of the animal, its proximity to the barriers, and habitat preference. We developed a mechanistic modelling framework for simultaneously quantifying the permeability and proximity effects of barriers on habitat preference and movement. We used simulations based on our model to demonstrate how parameters on movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability can be estimated statistically. We then applied the model to a case study of road effects on wild mountain reindeer summer movements. This framework provided unbiased and precise parameter estimates across a range of strengths of preferences and barrier permeabilities. The quality of permeability estimates, however, was correlated with the number of times the barrier is crossed and the number of locations in proximity to barriers. In the case study we found that reindeer avoided areas near roads and that roads are semi-permeable barriers to movement. There was strong avoidance of roads extending up to c. 1 km for four of five animals, and having to cross roads reduced the probability of movement by 68{$\cdot$}6\% (range 3{$\cdot$}5--99{$\cdot$}5\%). Human infrastructure has embedded within it the idea of networks: nodes connected by linear features such as roads, rail tracks, pipelines, fences and cables, many of which divide the landscape and limit animal movement. The unintended but potentially profound consequences of infrastructure on animals remain poorly understood. The rigorous framework for simultaneously quantifying movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability developed here begins to address this knowledge gap.},

To evaluate the potential efficacy of controlling the growth of lionfish population, we have proposed a non-smooth two-stage-structured mathematical model with two harvesting policies (non-selective and selective) of lionfish determined by a control function with a discontinuity at a critical herbivorous fish density. We study the sliding mode dynamics of the Filippov system, the boundary equilibrium bifurcation, and the pseudo-saddle-node bifurcation. We use threshold harvesting with hysteresis that helps in preventing the collapse of the herbivorous fish population through a bounded oscillation about pseudo-equilibrium. Our results show that a longer herbivorous fish harvesting period can be achieved in selective harvesting policy without compromising the herbivorous fish stock.},

  abstract = {Oligophagous and polyphagous predators are confronted with spatially and temporally varying distributions of prey. Their species-specific foraging strategies should be able to cope with this variability. Using an individual based model, we explore how diet breath and the spatial scale at which predators respond to prey affects their capture efficiency in four heterogeneous prey landscapes, and combinations thereof. We interpret the spatial scale of the predator's response as perceptual range, and propose giving-up density as a proxy for diet breadth. Foraging behaviour is evaluated for a total of 121 perceptual range/giving-up density combinations, with four of them reflecting the strategies adopted by real ladybeetle species. Foraging rules of oligophagous ladybeetles were generally not very effective in terms of attained predation rate when foraging in a single prey landscape, but appear to be more effective when foraging in multiple prey landscapes. This finding is compatible with the notion that oligophagous predators do not adopt a foraging strategy that is especially adapted to a specific prey landscape, but to multiple prey landscapes. Simulations further indicated that there was not a 'best' foraging rule that resulted in the highest predation rates for a range of spatial prey distributions and prey densities. The findings thus suggest that strategies of four ladybeetle species are effective in generating sufficient prey capture under a broad range of spatial distributions, rather than maximum capture under a narrower set of distributions.},

In this study, we investigate the role of tau, a neuronal microtubule-associated protein (MAP) known for its stabilizing effects on microtubules, in modulating lattice dynamics. Using in vitro reconstitution, kinetic Monte Carlo modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that tau, despite lacking enzymatic activity, accelerates tubulin exchange within the lattice, particularly at topological defect sites. Tau appears to stabilize longitudinal tubulin--tubulin interactions while destabilizing lateral ones, thereby enhancing the mobility and repair of lattice defects. These results challenge the traditional view of tau as merely a stabilizer, uncovering its active role in dynamically modulating microtubule lattice structure.},

We re-examined the hydrolysis of ATP by polymerized actin using mechanical quenched-flow methods to improve temporal resolution. The rate constant for ATP hydrolysis by polymerized Mg actin is 0.3 s-1, 3-fold faster than that measured manually. The ATP hydrolysis rate is similar when Mg ATP actin elongates either the pointed end or the barbed end of filaments. Polymerized Ca actin hydrolyzes ATP at 0.05 s-1. Mg ATP actin saturated with profilin can elongate barbed ends at {$>$}60 s-1, 2 orders of magnitude faster than ATP hydrolysis (0.3 s-1). Given that profilin binds to a surface on actin that is buried in the Holmes model of the actin filament, we expect that profilin will block subunit addition at the barbed end of a filament. Profilin must move from this site at rates much faster than it dissociates from monomers (4 s-1). ATP hydrolysis is not required for this movement.},

  abstract = {Random walk models are an important tool used for understanding how complex organisms redistribute themselves through space and time in search of targets such as food, shelter, or mates. These walks are easily studied with agent-based models, which can be used to ask which search strategy is best according to some efficiency metric. Current studies however, generally do not consider the full range of potential random walks, success metrics, and constraints on the walker, and implementation details vary widely. It is therefore difficult to compare results across studies. In this paper, we investigate predator search behaviour in a comprehensive space of key movement variables that allows the predator to select from a continuum of random walks ranging from Brownian walks (BWs) to correlated random walks (CorRWs) which include directional persistence, to composite random walks (ComRWs) which feature intensive and extensive search modes (ISMs and ESMs), and finally to more complex correlated composite random walks (CCRWs). We specifically focus on the search behaviour of a predator between the initiation of a search for a prey item and the first successful acquisition of a prey target: we call this interval the ``search-to-capture'' event. We measure the predator's success against three metrics of energetic cost: (1) the time elapsed, (2) the distance travelled, and (3) an equally weighted combination of time and distance. In addition, we explore the effect of three different constraints on the predator: (1) hunting success in the extensive search mode, (2) detection radius when in the extensive search mode, and (3) prey density. Our work confirms the broadly held notion that CCRW movement patterns should always outperform BWs, but find instructive cases where other walks are superior. We also show that, within the CCRW category, there is a wide range of possible walks and rank these according to measures of energetic cost. Our work also offers insights into the evolutionary pressures surrounding the ``search-to-capture'' event, and suggests that CCRW predators with low hunting success in one movement mode experience higher evolutionary pressures and are thus more likely to adopt a nearly optimal random walk. Our work highlights the need for comprehensive studies that examine several aspects of random walks simultaneously.},

The phase transition reflects a sudden switch in the dynamics. Its existence in systems with a finite range of interaction, however, remained unclear. Here we demonstrate the dynamical phase transition for nearest-neighbor Ising systems on the square and Bethe lattices through extensive computer simulations and by analytical results. Combining large-deviation techniques and Bethe-Guggenheim theory we prove the existence of the dynamical phase transition for arbitrary quenches, including those within the two-phase region. Strikingly, for any given initial condition we prove and explain the existence of non-trivial speed limits for the dynamical phase transition and the relaxation of magnetization, which are fully corroborated by simulations of the microscopic Ising model but are absent in the mean field setting. Pair correlations, which are neglected in mean field theory and trivial in the Curie-Weiss model, account for kinetic constraints due to frustrated local configurations that give rise to a global speed limit.},

  abstract = {The restriction endonuclease EcoRV can rapidly locate a short recognition site within long non-cognate DNA using `facilitated diffusion'. This process has long been attributed to a sliding mechanism, in which the enzyme first binds to the DNA via nonspecific interaction and then moves along the DNA by 1D diffusion. Recent studies, however, provided evidence that 3D translocations (hopping/jumping) also help EcoRV to locate its target site. Here we report the first direct observation of sliding and jumping of individual EcoRV molecules along nonspecific DNA. Using fluorescence microscopy, we could distinguish between a slow 1D diffusion of the enzyme and a fast translocation mechanism that was demonstrated to stem from 3D jumps. Salt effects on both sliding and jumping were investigated, and we developed numerical simulations to account for both the jump frequency and the jump length distribution. We deduced from our study the 1D diffusion coefficient of EcoRV, and we estimated the number of jumps occurring during an interaction event with nonspecific DNA. Our results substantiate that sliding alternates with hopping/jumping during the facilitated diffusion of EcoRV and, furthermore, set up a framework for the investigation of target site location by other DNA-binding proteins.},

Emanating from the canonical diffusion problem by Evans and Majumdar, restart has been shown to outperform the completion of many first-passage processes which otherwise would take longer time to finish. However, most of the studies so far assumed continuous time underlying first-passage time processes and moreover considered continuous time resetting restricting out restart processes broken up into synchronized time steps. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study discrete space and time first-passage processes under discrete time resetting in a general setup without specifying their forms. We sketch out the steps to compute the moments and the probability density function which is often intractable in the continuous time restarted process. A criterion that dictates when restart remains beneficial is then derived. We apply our results to a symmetric and a biased random walker in one-dimensional lattice confined within two absorbing boundaries. Numerical simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical results. Our method can be useful to understand the effect of restart on the spatiotemporal dynamics of confined lattice random walks in arbitrary dimensions.},

Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder. An effort is made to illustrate the theoretical models by describing many physical situations where anomalous diffusion laws have been-or could be-observed.},

  abstract = {In stochastic systems with weak noise, the logarithm of the stationary distribution becomes proportional to a large deviation rate function called the quasi-potential. The quasi-potential, and its characterization through a variational problem, lies at the core of the Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations theory [32]. In many interacting particle systems, the particle density is described by fluctuating hydrodynamics governed by Macroscopic Fluctuation Th\textsurd eory [6], which formally fits within Freidlin-Wentzell's framework with a weak noise proportional to 1/ N , where N is the number of particles. The quasi-potential then appears as a natural generalization of the equilibrium free energy to non-equilibrium particle systems. A key physical and practical issue is to actually compute quasi-potentials from their variational characterization for non-equilibrium systems for which detailed balance does not hold. We discuss how to perform such a computation perturbatively in an external parameter {$\lambda$}, starting from a known quasi-potential for {$\lambda$} = 0. In a general setup, explicit iterative formulae for all terms of the power-series expansion of the quasi-potential are given for the first time. The key point is a proof of solvability conditions that assure the existence of the perturbation expansion to all orders. We apply the perturbative approach to diffusive particles interacting through a mean-field potential. For such systems, the variational characterization of the quasi-potential was proven by Dawson and Gartner [18, 19]. Our perturbative analysis provides new explicit results about the quasi-potential and about fluctuations of one-particle observables in a simple example of mean field diffusions: the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model of coupled rotators [74]. This is one of few systems for which non-equilibrium free energies can be computed and analyzed in an effective way, at least perturbatively.},

The Eyring--Kramers formula classically provides a subexponential prefactor to this large deviation estimate. For irreversible diffusion processes, the equivalent of Arrhenius' law is given by the Freidlin--Wentzell theory. In this paper, we compute the associated prefactor and thereby generalise the Eyring--Kramers formula to irreversible diffusion processes. In our formula, the role of the potential is played by Freidlin--Wentzell's quasipotential, and a correction depending on the non-Gibbsianness of the system along the minimum action paths is highlighted. Our study assumes some properties for the vector field: (1) attractors are isolated points, (2) the dynamics restricted to basin of attraction boundaries are attracted to single points (which are saddlepoints of the vector field). We moreover assume that the minimum action paths that connect attractors to adjacent saddle-points (the instantons) have generic properties that are summarised in the conclusion. At a technical level, our derivation combines an exact computation for the firstorder WKB expansion around the instanton and an exact computation of the first-order match asymptotics expansion close to the saddle-point. While the results are exact once a formal expansion is assumed, the validity of these asymptotic expansions remains to be proven.},

We demonstrate that vectorial, random, and coupled hydrolysis mechanisms are not consistent with the dependence of catastrophe on tubulin concentration and show that, although single-protofilament models can explain many features of dynamics, they do not describe catastrophe as a multistep process. Finally, we present a new combined (coupled plus random hydrolysis) multiple-protofilament model that is a simple, analytically solvable generalization of a single-protofilament model. This model accounts for the observed lifetimes of growing microtubules, the delay to catastrophe following dilution and describes catastrophe as a multistep process.},

Such a negative correlation is predicted by the standard GTP-cap model, which posits that catastrophe is due to loss of a stabilizing cap of GTP-tubulin at the end of a growing microtubule. However, many other MAPs, notably Kinesin-4 and combinations of EB1 with XMAP215, contradict this general rule. In this review, we show that a more nuanced, but still simple, GTP-cap model, can account for the diverse regulatory activities of MAPs.},

These are expressed in terms of the local fluid velocity vector field v at each point within the interstices of a unit cell of the spatially periodic array and, for the dispersivity, the molecular diffusivity of the tracer particle through the fluid. Though the theory is complete, numerical results are not yet available owing to the complex structure of the local interstitial velocity field v. However, as an illustrative exercise, the theory is shown to correctly reduce in an appropriate limiting case to the well-known Taylor-Aris results for dispersion in circular capillaries.},

  abstract = {The interior of a living cell is a crowded, heterogenuous, fluctuating environment. Hence, a major challenge in modeling intracellular transport is to analyze stochastic processes within complex environments. Broadly speaking, there are two basic mechanisms for intracellular transport: passive diffusion and motor-driven active transport. Diffusive transport can be formulated in terms of the motion of an overdamped Brownian particle. On the other hand, active transport requires chemical energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis, and can be direction specific, allowing biomolecules to be transported long distances; this is particularly important in neurons due to their complex geometry. In this review a wide range of analytical methods and models of intracellular transport is presented. In the case of diffusive transport, narrow escape problems, diffusion to a small target, confined and single-file diffusion, homogenization theory, and fractional diffusion are considered. In the case of active transport, Brownian ratchets, random walk models, exclusion processes, random intermittent search processes, quasi-steady-state reduction methods, and mean-field approximations are considered. Applications include receptor trafficking, axonal transport, membrane diffusion, nuclear transport, protein-DNA interactions, virus trafficking, and the self-organization of subcellular structures.},

It is established that inference on the modes of mobility of molecules is central in cell biology since it reflects interactions between structures and determines functions of biomolecules in the cell. In that context, Brownian motion is a key component in short distance transportation (e.g. connectivity for signal transduction). Another dynamical process that has been heavily studied in the past decade is the motor-mediated transport (e.g. dynein, kinesin and myosin) of molecules. Primarily supported by actin filament and microtubule network, it ensures spatial organization and temporal synchronization in the intracellular mechanisms and structures. Nevertheless, the complexity of internal structures and molecular processes in the living cell influence the molecular dynamics and prevent the systematic application of pure Brownian or directed motion modeling. On the one hand, cytoskeleton density will hinder the free displacement of the particle, a phenomenon called subdiffusion. On the other hand, the cytoskeleton elasticity combined with thermal bending can contribute a phenomenon called superdiffusion. This paper discusses the basics of diffusion modes observed in eukariotic cells, by introducing the essential properties of these processes. Applications of diffusion models include protein trafficking and transport and membrane diffusion.},

During the formation of these home ranges scent marks provide important cues regarding the use of space by familiar and foreign packs. Previous models for territorial pattern formation have required a den site as the organizational center around which the territory is formed. However, well-defined wolf home ranges have been known to form in the absence of a den site, and even in the absence of surrounding packs. To date, the quantitative models have failed to describe a mechanism for such a process. In this paper we propose a mechanism. It involves interaction between scent marking and movement behavior in response to familiar scent marks. We show that the model yields distinct home ranges by this new means, and that the spatial profile of these home ranges is different from those arising from the territorial interactions with den sites. \copyright{} 2002 Society for Mathematical Biology.},

Whereas polymers such as F-actin will grow continuously as long as the subunit concentration is high enough, a steadily growing microtubule can suddenly shrink even when there is ample {$\alpha\beta$}-tubulin around. This remarkable behavior was discovered in 1984 when Tim Mitchison and Marc Kirschner deduced that microtubules switch from growth to shrinkage when they lose their GTP caps. Here, I review the canonical explanation of dynamic instability that was fleshed out in the years after its discovery. Many aspects of this explanation have been recently subverted, particularly those related to how GTP-tubulin forms polymers and why GTP hydrolysis disrupts them. I describe these developments and speculate on how our explanation of dynamic instability can be changed to accommodate them.},

Microtubule growth and shrinkage occur via addition and loss of {$\alpha\beta$}-tubulin subunits, which are biochemical processes. Dynamic microtubules can also engage in mechanical processes, such as exerting forces by pushing or pulling against a load. Recent advances at the intersection of biochemistry and mechanics have revealed the existence of multiple conformations of {$\alpha\beta$}-tubulin subunits and their central role in dictating the mechanisms of microtubule dynamics and force generation. It has become apparent that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) selectively target specific tubulin conformations to regulate microtubule dynamics, and mechanical forces can also influence microtubule dynamics by altering the balance of tubulin conformations. Importantly, the conformational states of tubulin dimers are likely to be coupled throughout the lattice: the conformation of one dimer can influence the conformation of its nearest neighbours, and this effect can propagate over longer distances. This coupling provides a long-range mechanism by which MAPs and forces can modulate microtubule growth and shrinkage. These findings provide evidence that the interplay between biochemistry and mechanics is essential for the cellular functions of microtubules.},

We discuss a model of dynamic instability based on the popular idea that growth is maintained by a cap at the tip of the fiber. The loss of this cap is thought to trigger the transition from growth to shrinkage, called a catastrophe. The model includes longitudinal interactions between the terminal tubulins of each protofilament and ``gating rescues'' between neighboring protofilaments. These interactions allow individual protofilaments to transiently shorten during a phase of overall microtubule growth. The model reproduces the reported dependency of the catastrophe rate on tubulin concentration, the time between tubulin dilution and catastrophe, and the induction of microtubule catastrophes by walking depolymerases. The model also reproduces the comet tail distribution that is characteristic of proteins that bind to the tips of growing microtubules.},

By use of polyanions, assembly-competent tubulin solutions of several milligrams/milliliter can be prepared which do not exhibit appreciable spontaneous assembly during the time-course of an experiment. Microtubule elongation can be initiated by the addition of known numbers of microtubule fragments. A detailed analysis of the resulting process demonstrates that: (a) rings are not obligatory intermediates in the nucleation sequence, and neither rings nor protofilament sheets are obligatory intermediates in the elongation reaction. (b) The end of an elongating microtubule often has a short region of open protofilament sheet or "C-microtubule" similar to that observed in vivo. (c) The development of turbidity follows a simple exponential approach to an equilibrium value. (d) The final equilibrium values are independent of the number of added nucleating fragments, while the initial growth rates and half-times to reach equilibrium are dependent on the number of added nuclei. (e) The final lengths of the microtubules at equilibrium are inversely proportional to the number of added fragments. (f) The equilibrium constants are independent of microtubule length. (g) The number of assembly and disassembly sites per microtubule is not a function of microtubule length. (h) The forward rate constants, the final polymer concentrations, and growth rates of microtubules are dependent upon the concentration of polyanion present. These results are strongly supportive of the idea that microtubule assembly is a "condensation-polymerization" and provide basic information on the kinetics and length distributions of the elongation in vitro.},

The LDP gives information on the rate of decay of probabilities of various types of rare events associated with the system. We illustrate this by establishing explicit exponential decay rates for probabilities of large total number of jobs in the system. As a corollary, we also show that probabilities of certain rare events can indeed depend on the rate of dn {$\rightarrow$} {$\infty$}.},

  abstract = {Diffusive transport of particles or, more generally, small objects, is a ubiquitous feature of physical and chemical reaction systems. In configurations containing confining walls or constrictions, transport is controlled both by the fluctuation statistics of the jittering objects and the phase space available to their dynamics. Consequently, the study of transport at the macro- and nanoscales must address both Brownian motion and entropic effects. Herein we report on recent advances in the theoretical and numerical investigation of stochastic transport occurring either in microsized geometries of varying cross sections or in narrow channels wherein the diffusing particles are hindered from passing each other (single-file diffusion). For particles undergoing biased diffusion in static suspension media enclosed by confining geometries, transport exhibits intriguing features such as 1) a decrease in nonlinear mobility with increasing temperature or also 2) a broad excess peak of the effective diffusion above the free diffusion limit. These paradoxical aspects can be understood in terms of entropic contributions resulting from the restricted dynamics in phase space. If, in addition, the suspension medium is subjected to external, time-dependent forcing, rectification or segregation of the diffusing Brownian particles becomes possible. Likewise, the diffusion in very narrow, spatially modulated channels is modified via contact particle--particle interactions, which induce anomalous sub-diffusion. The effective sub-diffusion constant for a driven single file also develops a resonance-like structure as a function of the confining coupling constant.},

Here, we focused upon spontaneous motions of an RGD-coated bead and, in particular, assessed to what extent these motions are attributable to (i) bulk cell movement (cell crawling), (ii) dynamics of focal adhesions, (iii) dynamics of lipid membrane, and/or (iv) dynamics of the underlying actin CSK driven by myosin motors.},

  abstract = {Saproxylic insects are characterised by their exceptional diversity and high proportion of threatened species. No recent studies have demonstrated the validity of habitat suitability analysis for scientifically based habitat management for these species. We studied the habitat requirements of the endangered longhorn beetle Cerambyx cerdo, a species with a supposed keystone function for the saproxylic insect community living on oaks. We used species distribution modelling based on datasets from Central Europe to understand the species--habitat relationships and to find the environmental variables responsible for habitat selection of C. cerdo. Our results show that the most important parameters, insolation, presence of oak sap, bark depth and the distance from the next colonised tree, are able to predict the presence of C. cerdo very well. A spatial validation procedure revealed very similar predictive power, indicating the general validity of our model. Tree-level parameters were shown to have a stronger effect on the occurrence probability than landscape-level predictors. To improve the tree-level conditions (e.g. insolation on the trunk) habitat management in the form of semi-open pasture landscapes is recommended from which many other taxa will also draw considerable benefit. The provision of such conditions over decades is the essential key in the conservation of this longhorn beetle species. The success of the European network of conservation areas ``Natura 2000'' heavily depends on broad biological knowledge of the designated protected species. The present paper shows that species distribution models can give valuable contributions for conservation in saproxylic insects.},

In particular, we show how a drift-diffusion model can capture the transient behaviour of electron, hole and exciton concentrations in heterogeneous devices. Furthermore, computer simulations can reveal interesting new insights into the role of concentration fluxes and internal electric fields. We demonstrate this approach by considering bilayer devices but where the interface is sinusiodal, not planar. To highlight the predictive capabilities of these computer simulations we consider the systematic variation of device morphologies and the effect this has on photovoltaic performance. In this manner, we can correlate the device performance with the device's internal structure and predict how the polymer morphology might be tailored to meet photovoltaic needs.},

Anthropogenic noise is a widespread, pervasive and increasing environmental pollutant and its negative impacts on animal fitness and behaviour have been well documented. Much of this evidence has come from studies concerning vertebrate species with very little evidence for terrestrial invertebrates, especially social living invertebrates. We compare movement speed, forage fragment size, and colony activity levels of ants exposed to intermittent elevated noise and in ambient noise conditions. We use intermittent and temporally unpredictable bursts of white noise produced from a vibration speaker to create the elevated noise profile. Ant movement speed increased under elevated noise conditions when travelling to collect forage material and when returning to the colony nest. The size of individually measured foraged material was significantly reduced under elevated noise conditions. Colony activity, the number of ants moving along the forage route, was not affected by elevated noise and was consistent throughout the foraging events. Increased foraging speed and smaller forage fragments suggests that the ants had to make more foraging trips over an extended period, which is likely to affect energy expenditure and increases exposure to predators. This is likely to have significant fitness impacts for the colony over time.},

Previous studies indicated that the class I MHC cytoplasmic tail imposes constraints on the molecule's diffusion. Here we used single particle tracking to study the mobility of the wild-type mouse H-2Ld class I MHC molecule and of seven cytoplasmic tail variants. Six of the variants have cytoplasmic tails of four or seven residues (differing in net charge), and one is tailless, yet all are susceptible to confinement in membrane domains. However, truncation of the cytoplasmic tail to 0--4 residues decreases the proportion of particles exhibiting confined diffusion and increases the proportion exhibiting simple diffusion. Particularly for the truncated mutants (tail length of 0--7 residues), many of the particles have complex trajectories and do not move at a constant speed or in the same mode of diffusion throughout the observation period. Several particles of the tailless H-2Ld mutant display a type of directed diffusion that is rarely observed for other H-2Ld mutants. Taken together, these data show that even short cytoplasmic tails can influence markedly class I MHC mobility and that cytoplasmic tail length and sequence affect the molecule's diffusion in the membrane.},

Based on the Chubinsky-Slater idea of a diffusing diffusivity, we here establish and analyze a minimal model framework of diffusion processes with fluctuating diffusivity. In particular, we demonstrate the equivalence of the diffusing diffusivity process with a superstatistical approach with a distribution of diffusivities, at times shorter than the diffusivity correlation time. At longer times, a crossover to a Gaussian distribution with an effective diffusivity emerges. Specifically, we establish a subordination picture of Brownian but non-Gaussian diffusion processes, which can be used for a wide class of diffusivity fluctuation statistics. Our results are shown to be in excellent agreement with simulations and numerical evaluations.},

This framework does not rely on specific properties of the search process and resetting procedure, allows for simpler derivation of known results, and leads to new ones. Concentrating on minimizing the mean hitting time, we show that resetting at a constant pace is the best possible option if resetting helps at all, and derive the equation for the optimal resetting pace. No resetting may be a better strategy if without resetting the probability of not finding a target decays with time to zero exponentially or faster. We also calculate splitting probabilities between the targets, and define the limits in which these can be manipulated by changing the resetting procedure. We moreover show that the number of moments of the hitting time distribution under resetting is not less than the sum of the numbers of moments of the resetting time distribution and the hitting time distribution without resetting.},

Reciprocally, the assembly of proteins can influence the reaction rates of these cycles. Such reciprocal coupling between assembly and reaction cycle is a prerequisite for behavior like dynamic instabilities, treadmilling, pattern formation, and oscillations between morphologies. While assemblies regulated by chemical reaction cycles gained traction, the concept of reciprocal coupling is under-explored. In this work, we provide two molecular design strategies to tweak the degree of reciprocal coupling between the assembly and reaction cycle. The strategies involve spacing the chemically active site away from the assembly or burying it into the assembly. We envision that design strategies facilitate the creation of reciprocally coupled and, by extension, dynamic supramolecular materials in the future.},

For this heterogeneous diffusion process (HDP) we analyse the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the tracer particles, the time averaged MSD, the spatial probability density function, and the first passage time dynamics from the cell boundary to the nucleus. Moreover we examine the non-ergodic properties of this process which are important for the correct physical interpretation of time averages of observables obtained from single particle tracking experiments. From extensive computer simulations of the 2D stochastic Langevin equation we present an in-depth study of this HDP. In particular, we find that the MSDs along the radial and azimuthal directions in a circular domain obey anomalous and Brownian scaling, respectively. We demonstrate that the time averaged MSD stays linear as a function of the lag time and the system thus reveals a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results will enable one to rationalise the diffusive motion of larger tracer particles such as viruses or submicron beads in biological cells.},

  abstract = {In the so-called ``microscopic'' models of vehicular traffic, attention is paid explicitly to each individual vehicle each of which is represented by a ``particle''; the nature of the ``interactions'' among these particles is determined by the way the vehicles influence each others' movement. Therefore, vehicular traffic, modeled as a system of interacting ``particles'' driven far from equilibrium, offers the possibility to study various fundamental aspects of truly nonequilibrium systems which are of current interest in statistical physics. Analytical as well as numerical techniques of statistical physics are being used to study these models to understand rich variety of physical phenomena exhibited by vehicular traffic. Some of these phenomena, observed in vehicular traffic under different circumstances, include transitions from one dynamical phase to another, criticality and self-organized criticality, metastability and hysteresis, phase-segregation, etc. In this critical review, written from the perspective of statistical physics, we explain the guiding principles behind all the main theoretical approaches. But we present detailed discussions on the results obtained mainly from the so-called ``particle-hopping'' models, particularly emphasizing those which have been formulated in recent years using the language of cellular automata.},

U.S.A. 106, 15160 (2009)] have found that in several systems the linear time dependence of the mean-square displacement (MSD) of diffusing colloidal particles, typical of normal diffusion, is accompanied by a non-Gaussian displacement distribution G(x,t), with roughly exponential tails at short times, a situation they termed ``anomalous yet Brownian'' diffusion. The diversity of systems in which this is observed calls for a generic model. We present such a model where there is diffusivity memory but no direction memory in the particle trajectory, and we show that it leads to both a linear MSD and a non-Gaussian G(x,t) at short times. In our model, the diffusivity is undergoing a (perhaps biased) random walk, hence the expression ``diffusing diffusivity''. G(x,t) is predicted to be exactly exponential at short times if the distribution of diffusivities is itself exponential, but an exponential remains a good fit for a variety of diffusivity distributions. Moreover, our generic model can be modified to produce subdiffusion.},

  abstract = {In neural circuits, synaptic strengths influence neuronal activity by shaping network dynamics, and neuronal activity influences synaptic strengths through activity-dependent plasticity. Motivated by this fact, we study a recurrent-network model in which neuronal units and synaptic couplings are interacting dynamic variables, with couplings subject to Hebbian modification with decay around quenched random strengths. Rather than assigning a specific role to the plasticity, we use dynamical mean-field theory and other techniques to systematically characterize the neuronal-synaptic dynamics, revealing a rich phase diagram. Adding Hebbian plasticity slows activity in already chaotic networks and can induce chaos in otherwise quiescent networks. Anti-Hebbian plasticity quickens activity and produces an oscillatory component. Analysis of the Jacobian shows that Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity push locally unstable modes toward the real and imaginary axes, respectively, explaining these behaviors. Both random-matrix and Lyapunov analysis show that strong Hebbian plasticity segregates network timescales into two bands, with a slow, synapse-dominated band driving the dynamics, suggesting a flipped view of the network as synapses connected by neurons. For increasing strength, Hebbian plasticity initially raises the complexity of the dynamics, measured by the maximum Lyapunov exponent and attractor dimension, but then decreases these metrics, likely due to the proliferation of stable fixed points. We compute the marginally stable spectra of such fixed points as well as their number, showing exponential growth with network size. Finally, in chaotic states with strong Hebbian plasticity, a stable fixed point of neuronal dynamics is destabilized by synaptic dynamics, allowing any neuronal state to be stored as a stable fixed point by halting the plasticity. This phase of freezable chaos offers a new mechanism for working memory.},

While a decade ago minimalist toy models were mainly designed to test general hypotheses on the principles regulating protein folding, the latest coarse-grained models are increasingly realistic and can be used to characterize quantitatively the detailed folding mechanism of specific proteins. The ability of such models to reproduce the essential features of folding dynamics suggests that each single atomic degree of freedom is not by itself particularly relevant to folding and supports a statistical mechanical approach to characterize folding transitions. When combined with more refined models and with experimental studies, the systematic investigation of protein systems and complexes using coarse-grained models can advance our theoretical understanding of the actual organizing principles that emerge from the complex network of interactions among protein atomic constituents.},

Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

In a two-dimensional biased random walk, the diffusion about the mean drift position is entirely dependent on the moments of the angular distribution used to determine the movement direction at each step. Here we consider biased random walks using several different angular distributions and derive expressions for the diffusion coefficients in each direction based on either a fixed or variable movement speed, and we use these to generate a probability density function for the long-time spatial distribution. We demonstrate how diffusion is typically anisotropic around the mean drift position and illustrate these theoretical results using computer simulations. We relate these results to earlier studies of swimming microorganisms and explain how the results can be generalized to other types of animal movement.},

Because of the small sizes of bacterial cells, superresolution methods are particularly powerful and suitable for revealing details of cellular structures that are not resolvable under conventional fluorescence light microscopy. Here we describe the methodological concepts behind three major categories of superresolution light microscopy: photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and stimulated emission-depletion (STED) microscopy. We then present recent applications of each of these techniques to microbial systems, which have revealed novel conformations of cellular structures and described new properties of in vivo protein function and interactions. Finally, we discuss the unique issues related to implementing each of these superresolution techniques with bacterial specimens and suggest avenues for future development. The goal of this review is to provide the necessary technical background for interested microbiologists to choose the appropriate superresolution method for their biological systems, and to introduce the practical considerations required for designing and analysing superresolution imaging experiments.},

  abstract = {A key issue in macromolecular structure modeling is the granularity of the molecular representation. A fine-grained representation can approximate the actual structure more accurately, but may require many more degrees of freedom than a coarse-grained representation and hence make conformational search more challenging. We investigate this tradeoff between the accuracy and the size of protein conformational search space for two frequently used representations: one with fixed bond angles and lengths and one that has full flexibility. We performed large-scale explorations of the energy landscapes of 82 protein domains under each model, and find that the introduction of bond angle flexibility significantly increases the average energy gap between native and non-native structures. We also find that incorporating bonded geometry flexibility improves low resolution X-ray crystallographic refinement. These results suggest that backbone bond angle relaxation makes an important contribution to native structure energetics, that current energy functions are sufficiently accurate to capture the energetic gain associated with subtle deformations from chain ideality, and more speculatively, that backbone geometry distortions occur late in protein folding to optimize packing in the native state.},

Beetle representing different vegetation cover types and grazing intensities. Beetle movements were strongly influenced by vegetation structure, with net displacements highest in bare ground and grass cover types and lowest in cactus and shrub. The tree beetle species responded differently to grazing intensity. 3. When pathway structure was analysed by its fractal dimension, a measure which incorporates several length scales, beetle species differing in body size and similar pathway structures over a broad range of microlandscape heterogeneity. 4. simulation using a correlated random walk showed that observed beetle pathways had significantly greater net displacements than theoretical expectations for all treatment groups, but were closer to expected values in cactus and shrub than in bare ground and grass vegetation. 5. The fractal dimensions of observed beetle pathways were also different from simulated pathways, indicating that the similarity in the fractal structure of movement pathways observed in field treatments was not artefactual. Recognition of this size-scaled similarity in animal movement studies may facilitate comparisons of movement properties of animals that respond to the patch structure of the landscape at different spatial scales.}

Collective properties of multiple bio-filaments (actin or microtubules) undergoing hydrolysis have not been studied extensively earlier within simple theoretical frameworks. In this paper, we study the collective dynamical properties of multiple filaments under force, and demonstrate the distinct properties of a multi-filament system in comparison to a single filament. Comparing stochastic simulation results with recent experimental data, we show that multifilament collective catastrophes are slower than catastrophes of single filaments. Our study also shows further distinctions as follows: (i) force-dependence of the cap-size distribution of multiple filaments are quantitatively different from that of single filaments, (ii) the diffusion constant associated with the system length fluctuations is distinct for multiple filaments, and (iii) switching dynamics of multiple filaments between capped and uncapped states and the fluctuations therein are also distinct. We build a unified picture by establishing interconnections among all these collective phenomena. Additionally, we show that the collapse times during catastrophes can be sharp indicators of collective stall forces exceeding the additive contributions of single filaments.},

In this context, the discovery process can be modeled in terms of a dynamic process such as agents moving in a knowledge space. Recent studies proposed more realistic dynamics which can be influenced by the visibility of the agents, or by their memory. However, rather than dealing with these two concepts separately, in this study we propose a multi-agent random walk model for knowledge acquisition that integrates both these aspects. More specifically, we employed the true self avoiding walk modified to incorporate a type of stochastic flight. Such flights depend on fields of visibility emanating from the various agents, in an attempt to model the influence between researchers. The proposed framework has been illustrated considering a set of network models and two real-world networks, one generated from Wikipedia (articles from biology and mathematics) and another from the Web of Science comprising only the area of complex networks. The results were analyzed globally and by regions. In the global analysis, we found that most of the dynamics parameters do not affect significantly the discovery process. Yet, the local analysis revealed a substantial difference in performance, depending on the local topology. In particular, dynamics taking place at the core of the networks tended to enhance knowledge acquisition. The choice of the parameters controlling the dynamics were found to have little impact on the performance for the considered knowledge networks, even at the local scale.},

Although this mode of self-assembly is ubiquitous in nature, where it gives rise to functions such as signal processing, motility, self-healing, self-replication, and ultimately life, examples of dissipative self-assembly processes in man-made systems are few and far between. Herein, recent progress in developing diverse synthetic dissipative self-assembly systems is discussed. The systems reported thus far can be categorized into three classes, in which: i) the fuel chemically modifies the building blocks, thus triggering their self-assembly, ii) the fuel acts as a template interacting with the building blocks noncovalently, and iii) transient states are induced by the addition of two mutually exclusive stimuli. These early studies give rise to materials that would be difficult to obtain otherwise, including hydrogels with programmable lifetimes, vesicular nanoreactors, and membranes exhibiting transient conductivity.},

  abstract = {Some forms of speculative trading share similarities with gambling. Decisions are often based on limited information, short-term motives for gain, and highly volatile and uncertain outcomes. Given these similarities, there is evidence to show that people who are attracted to gambling are also statistically more likely to engage in higher risk speculation such as day-trading of stocks and crypto-currency trading. In this study, involving 543 people (M~=~388, F~=~155, 85\% aged 18--40~years) who reported at least monthly sports-betting, crypto-currency trading or both, we examined whether gambling and problem gambling were reliable predictors of the reported intensity of crypto-currency trading. The results showed that gambling and problem gambling rates were highest among those who reported both activities and that problem gambling scores (PGSI) and engaging in stock trading was significantly related to measures of crypto-currency trading intensity as based on the time spent per day, number of trades and level of expenditure. Future research should examine whether gambling history and involvement influences how people manage their investments in crypto-currencies, including their propensity for making riskier decisions and experiencing more negative outcomes.},

  abstract = {Active matter systems evade the constraints of thermal equilibrium, leading to the emergence of intriguing collective behavior. A paradigmatic example is given by motor-filament mixtures, where the motion of motor proteins drives alignment and sliding interactions between filaments and their self-organization into macroscopic structures. After defining a microscopic model for these systems, we derive continuum equations, exhibiting the formation of active supramolecular assemblies such as micelles, bilayers, and foams. The transition between these structures is driven by a branching instability, which destabilizes the orientational order within the micelles, leading to the growth of bilayers at high microtubule densities. Additionally, we identify a fingering instability, modulating the shape of the micelle interface at high motor densities. We study the role of various mechanisms in these two instabilities, such as contractility, active splay, and anchoring, allowing for generalization beyond the system considered here.},

Determining these asymptotics is an essential step toward analyzing the fractal structure of the set of uncovered sites before coverage is complete; so far, this structure was only studied non-rigorously in the physics literature. We also establish a conjecture, due to Kesten and R\textasciiacute ev\textasciiacute esz, that describes the asymptotics for the number of steps needed by simple random walk in Z2 to cover the disc of radius n.},

Many of these applications involve the immigration of new species into the system. We consider the full high-dimensional stochastic process associated with multispecies birth--death--immigration and present a number of exact and asymptotic results at steady state. We further include random mutations or interactions through a carrying capacity and find the statistics of the total number of individuals, the total number of species, the species size distribution, and various diversity indices. Our results include a rigorous analysis of the behavior of these systems in the fast immigration limit which shows that of the different diversity indices, the species richness is best able to distinguish different types of birth--death--immigration models. We also find that detailed balance is preserved in the simple noninteracting birth--death--immigration model and the birth--death--immigration model with carrying capacity implemented through death. Surprisingly, when carrying capacity is implemented through the birth rate, detailed balance is violated.},

This is a very hard and challenging domain because current systems are complex, distributed, interconnected and rapidly changing systems. We firmly believe that a main challenge in conquering autonomic systems is the integration of three existing research communities: the multiagent systems community allows natural modelling of the system and explicitly considers autonomous behaviour and distributed interaction, dynamical systems theory allows analysis of the dynamics of these models and the decentralised control community can use insights gathered from the analysis to create decentralised control mechanisms to control the dynamics of autonomic systems. We describe this generic perspective on autonomic computing, give an overview of the relevant work done in each community and describe the contribution of each community in conquering autonomic computing.},

We highlight the essential role of coarse graining in space from mathematical, thermodynamical, and experimental points of view. Spatial coarse graining is required to uncover salient features of currents that break detailed balance, and a thermodynamically ``optimal'' coarse graining ensures the most precise inference of dissipation. Defined without coarse graining, the fluctuations of empirical density and current are proven to diverge on all timescales in dimensions higher than one, which has far-reaching consequences for the central-limit regime in continuous space.

  abstract = {In this paper we consider the issue of sliding motion in Filippov systems on the intersection of two or more surfaces. To this end, we propose an extension of the Filippov sliding vector field on manifolds of co-dimension p, with p~{$\geq$} 2. Our model passes through the use of a multivalued sign function reformulation. To justify our proposal, we will restrict to cases where the sliding manifold is attractive. For the case of co-dimension p~=~2, we will distinguish between two types of attractive sliding manifold: ``node-like'' and ``spiral-like''. The case of node-like attractive manifold will be further extended to the case of p~{$\geq$} 3. Finally, we compare our model to other existing methodologies on some examples.},

  abstract = {Information is acquired through cognitive processes and is essential for enhanced fitness in many animal species. However, little is known about intraspecific variation in cognitive performance, or about phenotypic correlates of this variation, especially in invertebrates. Here we quantified individual variation in spatial learning, exploration, boldness and thigmotaxis (wall hugging) in female Texas field crickets, Gryllus texensis. We trained females to locate a food reward (dish baited with food) located in one arm of a radial arm maze, followed by a cognitive test (probe) trial where no food reward was present. Our results suggest that female crickets could learn and remember the food location, as latency to find the reward dish, distance travelled, number of complete arm entries and number of errors made prior to finding the reward dish all declined with training trials and during the cognitive test trial. Furthermore, females performed equally well on all cognitive measures during the cognitive test trial and the last training trial, suggesting they did not rely on olfactory cues to locate the correct dish during the cognitive test trial. Individual variation in cognitive measures during the test trial were significantly negatively correlated with thigmotaxis during the trial, but were not correlated with body size, latency to leave the novel maze's acclimation zone or the percentage of the novel maze explored during initial exploration of the maze. Our findings suggest individuals with reduced thigmotaxis either (1) are better at learning a spatial task and/or (2) rely more heavily on vision than olfaction. These results contribute to the growing literature examining links between personality and cognition, and highlight the importance of quantifying correlated aspects of the phenotype when assessing individual variation in cognitive performance in a cognitive test.},

  abstract = {The regular arrangements of {$\beta$}-strands around a central axis in {$\beta$}-barrels and of {$\alpha$}-helices in coiled coils contrast with the irregular tertiary structures of most globular proteins, and have fascinated structural biologists since they were first discovered. Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of {$\alpha$}-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with {$\beta$}-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of {$\beta$}-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of {$\beta$}-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI,~and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.},

To this end, we propose a simple model of infection that enables to study the coincidence time of two random walkers on an arbitrary graph. By studying the coincidence time of a susceptible and an infected individual both moving in the graph we obtain estimates of the infection probability. The main result of this paper is to pinpoint the impact of the network topology on the infection probability. More precisely, we prove that for homogeneous graphs including regular graphs and the classical Erd\H os--R\'enyi model, the coincidence time is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in the graph. We then study the model on power-law graphs, that exhibit heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and show the existence of a phase transition for the coincidence time depending on the parameter of the power-law of the degree distribution. We finally undertake a preliminary analysis for the case with k random walkers and provide upper bounds on the convergence time for both the complete graph and regular graphs.},

From the exact inter-particle probability distribution, a simple physical picture emerges: the reset mainly changes the behaviour at larger distance scales, while at smaller length scales, the non-trivial correlation of the model without a reset dominate.}

For both autocatalytic and nonautocatalytic reactions, the analysis of the distribution about a stable stationary state and of the transitions between coexisting stable states comes, to logarithmic accuracy, to the analysis of Hamiltonian dynamics of an auxiliary dynamical system. The latter can be done explicitly in a few cases, including one-species systems, systems with detailed balance, and systems close to the bifurcation points where the number of the stable states changes. In the last case, the fluctuations display universal features, and, for saddle-node bifurcation points, the logarithm of the probability of escape from the metastable state (per unit time) is proportional to the distance to the bifurcation point (in the parameter space) raised to the power 3/2. We compare the eikonal approximation for the stationary distribution of a master equation to Monte Carlo numerical solutions for two chemical two-variable systems with multiple stationary states, where none of the cited restrictions exists. For one of the systems in the pattern of optimal paths we observe caustics emanating from the saddle point.},

We present a new approach to building class-specific backbones, using a variational auto-encoder to directly generate the 3D coordinates of immunoglobulins. Our model is torsion- and distance-aware, learns a high-resolution embedding of the dataset, and generates novel, high-quality structures compatible with existing design tools. We show that the Ig-VAE can be used with Rosetta to create a computational model of a SARS-CoV2-RBD binder via latent space sampling. We further demonstrate that the model's generative prior is a powerful tool for guiding computational protein design, motivating a new paradigm under which backbone design is solved as constrained optimization problem in the latent space of a generative model.},

  abstract = {Since life in a terrestrial environment threatens mammals continuously with desiccation, the structural, cellular, biochemical, and regulatory mechanisms that sustain permeability barrier homeostasis have justifiably comprised a major thrust of prior and recent research on epidermal barrier function. Yet, the epidermis mediates a broad set of protective `barrier' functions that includes defense against pathogen challenges. Permeability and antimicrobial function are both co-regulated and interdependent, overlapping through the dual activities of their lipid/protein constituents. Most of the defensive (barrier) functions of the epidermis localize to the stratum corneum (SC), which limits pathogen colonization through its low water content, acidic pH, resident (normal) microflora, and surface-deposited antimicrobial lipids (1{$^\circ$} free fatty acid). These various barrier functions are largely mediated by either the corneocyte or the extracellular matrix, and it is both the localization and the organization of secreted hydrophobic lipids into characteristic lamellar bilayers that is critical not only for permeability barrier function, but also for antimicrobial function through its contribution to the maintenance of SC integrity. Low constitutive levels of antimicrobial peptides under basal conditions emphasize the key role of epithelial structure in antimicrobial defense. But antimicrobial peptide synthesis and delivery to the SC interstices accelerates after external insults to the barrier.},

  abstract = {Gambling is a common activity amongst young adults in the UK, and was a behavior of interest during the early mitigation against COVID-19 (first lockdown). The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was used to investigate attitudes, moods and behavior during lockdown in England. ALSPAC participants were invited to complete online questionnaires in May 2020, including a set of questions about frequency of gambling and gambling activities which had been asked three years previously. Mental health and wellbeing data and alcohol use were also collected as part of lockdown questionnaires. Gambling questions were completed by 2632 young adults, 71\% female, with a mean age of 27.8 years. Overall, gambling frequency reduced during lockdown for both males and females, but more males engaged in regular (weekly) gambling. Gambling activities became more restricted compared to previous reports, but online gambling (e.g. online poker, bingo, casino games) was more frequent. Previous gambling behaviour predicted gambling frequency during lockdown. No associations were apparent between gambling frequency and measures of mental health and well-being. Heavy alcohol use was strongly linked with regular gambling during lockdown. Gamblers were more than twice as likely as non-gamblers to have experienced financial difficulties pre-COVID, but gambling frequency was not related to employment status during lockdown. Online gambling increased during lockdown, whilst offline gambling activities decreased in frequency. A small minority of regular weekly gamblers, who tended to be male and heavy users of alcohol, participated in a wide range of online and offline gambling activities.},

The book can be used both for self-study and as a supporting text for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate-level courses in applied mathematics. New mathematical approaches are explained using simple examples of biological models, which range in size from simulations of small biomolecules to groups of animals. The book starts with stochastic modelling of chemical reactions, introducing stochastic simulation algorithms and mathematical methods for analysis of stochastic models. Different stochastic spatio-temporal models are then studied, including models of diffusion and stochastic reaction-diffusion modelling. The methods covered include molecular dynamics, Brownian dynamics, velocity jump processes and compartment-based (lattice-based) models},

Structured illumination microscopy revealed single {$\gamma$}-secretase complexes with a monodisperse distribution and in a 1:1 stoichiometry of PSEN1 and nicastrin subunits. In living cells, sptPALM revealed PSEN1/{$\gamma$}-secretase mainly with directed motility and frequenting `hotspots' or high track-density areas that are sensitive to {$\gamma$}-secretase inhibitors. We visualized {$\gamma$}-secretase association with substrates like amyloid precursor protein and N-cadherin, but not with its sheddases ADAM10 or BACE1 at the cell surface, arguing against pre-formed megadalton complexes. Nonetheless, in living cells PSEN1/{$\gamma$}-secretase transiently visits ADAM10 hotspots.

Some proteins show tandem repetitions of apparent modular structure that do not fold independently, but rather co-operate in stabilizing structural forms that comprise several repeat-units. For many natural repeat-proteins, it has been shown that weak energetic links between repeats lead to the breakdown of co-operativity and the appearance of folding sub-domains within an apparently regular repeat array. The quasi-1D architecture of repeat-proteins is crucial in detailing how the local energetic balances can modulate the folding dynamics of these proteins, which can be related to the physiological behaviour of these ubiquitous biological systems.},

We compute the nonequilibrium stationary state which exhibits non-Gaussian behaviour. We then consider the presence of an absorbing target centred at the origin and compute the survival probability and mean time to absorption of the diffusive particle by the target. The mean absorption time is finite and has a minimum value at an optimal resetting rate r which depends on dimension. Finally we consider the problem of a finite density of diffusive particles, each resetting to its own initial position. While the typical survival probability of the target at the origin decays exponentially with time regardless of spatial dimension, the average survival probability decays asymptotically as exp\textquestiondown ( \textquestiondown{} A (ln\textquestiondown{} t ) d ) where A is a constant. We explain these findings using an interpretation as a renewal process and arguments invoking extreme value statistics.}

  abstract = {Memory is critical to understanding animal movement but has proven challenging to study. Advances in animal tracking technology, theoretical movement models and cognitive sciences have facilitated research in each of these fields, but also created a need for synthetic examination of the linkages between memory and animal movement. Here, we draw together research from several disciplines to understand the relationship between animal memory and movement processes. First, we frame the problem in terms of the characteristics, costs and benefits of memory as outlined in psychology and neuroscience. Next, we provide an overview of the theories and conceptual frameworks that have emerged from behavioural ecology and animal cognition. Third, we turn to movement ecology and summarise recent, rapid developments in the types and quantities of available movement data, and in the statistical measures applicable to such data. Fourth, we discuss the advantages and interrelationships of diverse modelling approaches that have been used to explore the memory--movement interface. Finally, we outline key research challenges for the memory and movement communities, focusing on data needs and mathematical and computational challenges. We conclude with a roadmap for future work in this area, outlining axes along which focused research should yield rapid progress.},

  abstract = {Starting at the mesoscopic level with a general formulation of stochastic thermodynamics in terms of Markov jump processes, we identify the scaling conditions that ensure the emergence of a (typically nonlinear) deterministic dynamics and an extensive thermodynamics at the macroscopic level. We then use large deviations theory to build a macroscopic fluctuation theory around this deterministic behavior, which we show preserves the fluctuation theorem. For many systems (e.g. chemical reaction networks, electronic circuits, Potts models), this theory does not coincide with Langevin-equation approaches (obtained by adding Gaussian white noise to the deterministic dynamics) which, if used, are thermodynamically inconsistent. Einstein-Onsager theory of Gaussian fluctuations and irreversible thermodynamics are recovered at equilibrium and close to it, respectively. Far from equilibirum, the free energy is replaced by the dynamically generated quasi-potential (or self-information) which is a Lyapunov function for the macroscopic dynamics. Remarkably, thermodynamics connects the dissipation along deterministic and escape trajectories to the Freidlin-Wentzell quasi-potential, thus constraining the transition rates between attractors induced by rare fluctuations. A coherent perspective on minimum and maximum entropy production principles is also provided. For systems that admit a continuous-space limit, we derive a nonequilibrium fluctuating field theory with its associated thermodynamics. Finally, we coarse grain the macroscopic stochastic dynamics into a Markov jump process describing transitions among deterministic attractors and formulate the stochastic thermodynamics emerging from it.},

A comprehensive set of performance metrics are considered, including the distance the robots travel, the frequency of visiting points in the target area, and the degree of balance in workload distribution among the robots. The Cyclic Coverage approach, used as a benchmark to compare the algorithms, produces optimal or near-optimal solutions for the single robot case under some criteria. The results can be used as a framework for choosing an appropriate combination of repeated coverage algorithm, environment representation, and the robots' visual range based on the particular scenario and the metric to be optimized.},

Here we address this issue through a systematic study of L\'evy searches in landscapes encompassing several degrees of target aggregation and fractality. For scarce resources, non-destructive searches with unrestricted revisits to targets are shown to present universal optimal behavior irrespective of the general scaling properties of the spatial distribution of targets. In contrast, no such universal behavior occurs in the destructive case with forbidden revisits, in which the optimal strategy strongly depends on the degree of target aggregation. We also investigate how the presence of memory and learning skills of the searcher affect the search efficiency. By considering a limiting model in which the searcher learns through recent experience to recognize food-rich areas, we find that a statistical memory of previous encounters does not necessarily increase the rate of target findings in random searches. Instead, there is an optimal extent of memory, dependent on specific details of the search space and stochastic dynamics, which maximizes the search efficiency. This finding suggests a more general result, namely that in some instances there are actual advantages to ignoring certain pieces of partial information while searching for objects.},

  abstract = {Repeat-proteins are made up of near repetitions of 20-- to 40--amino acid stretches. These polypeptides usually fold up into non-globular, elongated architectures that are stabilized by the interactions within each repeat and those between adjacent repeats, but that lack contacts between residues distant in sequence. The inherent symmetries both in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure are reflected in a folding landscape that may be analyzed as a quasi--one-dimensional problem. We present a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes based on a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, whose collective ensemble are treated as spin variables. The overall folding properties of a complete ``domain'' (the stability and cooperativity of the repeating array) can be derived from this microscopic description. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies there are simple relations for the experimental observables: folding free-energy (DGwater) and the cooperativity of denaturation (m-value), which do not ordinarily apply for globular proteins. We show how the parameters for the ``coarse-grained'' description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. To illustrate the ideas, we present a case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins and quantitatively relate the results to the experimentally observed folding transitions. Based on the dramatic effect that single point mutations exert on the experimentally observed folding behavior, we speculate that natural repeat proteins are ``poised'' at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics that allow them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions.},

  abstract = {A discrete reaction-diffusion model was used to estimate long-term equilibrium populations of a hypothetical species inhabiting patchy landscapes to examine the relative importance of habitat amount and arrangement in explaining population size. When examined over a broad range of habitat amounts and arrangements, population size was largely determined by a pure amount effect (proportion of habitat in the landscape accounted for {$>$}96\% of the total variation compared to {$<$}1\% for the arrangement main effect). However, population response deviated from a pure amount effect as coverage was reduced below 30\%--50\%. That deviation coincided with a persistence threshold as indicated by a rapid decline in the probability of landscapes supporting viable populations. When we partitioned experimental landscapes into sets of ``above'' and ``below'' persistence threshold, habitat arrangement became an important factor in explaining population size below threshold conditions. Regression analysis on below-threshold landscapes using explicit measures of landscape structure (after removing the covariation with habitat amount) indicated that arrangement variables accounted for 33\%--39\% of the variation in population size, compared to 27\%--49\% for habitat amount. Thus, habitat arrangement effects became important when species persistence became uncertain due to dispersal mortality.},

  abstract = {Aedes mosquito-transmitted diseases, such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya, are becoming major global health emergencies while old threats, such as yellow fever, are re-emerging. Traditional control methods, which have focused on reducing mosquito populations through the application of insecticides or preventing breeding through removal of larval habitat, are largely ineffective, as evidenced by the increasing global disease burden. Here, we review novel mosquito population reduction and population modification approaches with a focus on control methods based on the release of mosquitoes, including the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and strategies to genetically modify the vector, that are currently under development and have the potential to contribute to a reversal of the current alarming disease trends.},

The questionnaire included a standard screen, DSM-IV-MR-J, to test for problem gambling. Our regression models explore influences of demographic, home and school characteristics on probabilities (both unconditional and conditional on being a gambler) of a child testing positive for problem gambling. More than 20\% of children participated in gambling and, of these, nearly 8\% tested positive. Age-group prevalence of problem gambling was 1.9\%, compared with 0.6--0.9\% in the most recent official adult surveys. Boys were much more likely than girls to gamble and to exhibit symptoms of problem gambling if they did. Generally, home characteristics, particularly parental attitude and example, dominated school characteristics in accounting for risks. Unanticipated findings included significantly elevated probabilities of problem gambling among Asian children and among children who live in a home without siblings. Child income was also a potent predictor of gambling and problem gambling.},

When those children had been age 6, each of their parents was asked about their own gambling. We used regression to estimate the effect of parental gambling behaviour at child age 6 on the child's problem gambling risk at age 20. Parental gambling participation at child age 6 was not a predictor of offspring problem gambling; but problem gambling by parents was a predictor of offspring problem gambling. However, this latter result was found only cross-gender (fathers' behaviour influencing daughters and mothers' behaviour influencing sons). This pattern was robust to models including measures of parental education and variables capturing family attitudes to health choices and the degree of domestic harmony. The sample illustrates high problem gambling prevalence amongst young adults. Although there is transmission of `problem gambling' between generations, it appears to happen only cross-gender. This limits the importance of parental problem gambling as a source of the high prevalence because relatively few mothers exhibit problem gambling and risks to daughters from fathers are in the context of initially low baseline risks. Preventative policies might therefore be more appropriately targeted at young adults rather than rely on influencing parental gambling behaviour earlier in the child's life.},

  abstract = {This work presents a new perspective on characterizing the similarity between elements of a database or, more generally, nodes of a weighted and undirected graph. It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the "length" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the "Fiedler vector," widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called "statistical relational learning" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database},

Carcass sites can increase species interactions and/or ephemeral, localized landscapes of fear for prey within the vicinity. Few studies have applied the landscape of fear to carcasses. Here, we use a mass die-off of reindeer caused by lightning in Norway to test whether rodents avoided larger scavengers (e.g. corvids and fox). We used the presence and abundance of faeces as a proxy for carcass use over the course of 2 years and found that rodents showed the strongest avoidance towards changes in raven abundance ({$\beta$} = -0.469, s.e. = 0.231, p-value = 0.0429), but not fox, presumably due to greater predation risk imposed by large droves of raven. Moreover, the emergence of rodent occurrence within the carcass area corresponded well with the disappearance of raven during the second year of the study. We suggest that carcasses have the potential to shape the landscape of fear for prey, but that the overall effects of carcasses on individual fitness and populations of species ultimately depend on the carcass regime, e.g. carcass size, count, and areal extent, frequency and the scavenger guild. We discuss conservation implications and how carcass provisioning and landscapes of fear could be potentially used to manage populations and ecosystems, but that there is a gap in understanding that must first be bridged.},

  abstract = {A new mathematical model for permeability of chemicals in aqueous vehicle through skin is presented. The rationale for this model is to represent diffusion by its fundamental molecular mechanism, i.e., random thermal motion. Diffusion is modeled as a two-dimensional random walk through the biphasic (lipid and corneocyte) stratum corneum (SC). This approach permits calculations of diffusion phenomena in a morphologically realistic SC structure. Two concepts are key in the application of the model to the prediction of steady-state skin permeability coefficients: ``effective diffusivity'' and ``effective path length,'' meaning the diffusivity and thickness of a homogeneous membrane having identical permeation properties as the stratum corneum. Algebraic expressions for these two variables are developed as functions of the molecular weight and octanol-water partition coefficient of the diffusing substance. Combining these with expressions for membrane-vehicle partition coefficient and permeability of the aqueous epidermis enables the calculation of steady-state skin permeability coefficients. The resulting four-parameter algebraic model was regressed against the ``Flynn data base'' with excellent results (R2=0.84;SE=0.0076; F=154;N=94). The model provides insight into the contributions of stratum corneum diffusivity and effective path lengths to overall skin permeability and may prove useful in the prediction of non-steady-state diffusion phenomena.},

This case often occurs in important systems, such as protective coatings or membranes, which are routinely studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Relations are obtained that connect the diffusion impedance of a multilayer to the impedances of individual layers and also take into account partitioning effects. It is shown that the equivalent circuit that correctly represents the total diffusion impedance (e.g., for use in EIS spectra fitting algorithms) consists of several O and T (bounded Warburg) elements connected in a complex way. Analysis of limiting cases shows that the low-frequency limiting behavior of a multilayer film may significantly differ from those of individual layers showing asymmetry and synergism. In particular, it is shown that a thin layer of solution between an electrode and a resistant film to be characterized may seriously interfere with the measurements.},

In order to provide an explicit expression for the probability distribution valid away from equilibrium, we propose a linear response theory performed at the level of the rate function. We show that the first order non-equilibrium contribution to the steady state rate function, g(x), satisfies u(x) {$\cdot$} ∇g(x) = -{$\beta$}W˙ (x) where the vector field u(x) defines the macroscopic deterministic dynamics, and the scalar field W˙ (x) equals the rate at which work is performed on the system in a given state x. This equation provides a practical way to determine g(x), significantly outperforms standard linear response theory applied at the level of the probability distribution, and approximates the rate function surprisingly well in some far-from-equilibrium conditions. The method applies to a wealth of physical and chemical systems, that we exemplify by two analytically tractable models---an electrical circuit and an autocatalytic chemical reaction network---both undergoing a non-equilibrium transition from a monostable phase to a bistable phase. Our approach can be easily generalized to transient probabilities and non-autonomous dynamics. Moreover, its recursive application generates a virtual flow in the probability space which allows to determine the steady state rate function arbitrarily far from equilibrium.},

  abstract = {The analysis of animal movement is a large and continuously growing field of research. Detailed knowledge about movement strategies is of crucial importance for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics at all scales -- from individuals to (meta-)populations. This and the availability of detailed movement and dispersal data motivated Nathan and colleagues to published their much appreciated call to base movement ecology on a more thorough mechanistic basis. So far, most movement models are based on random walks. However, even if a random walk might describe real movement patterns acceptably well, there is no reason to assume that animals move randomly. Therefore, mechanistic models of foraging strategies should be based on information use and memory in order to increase our understanding of the processes that lead to animal movement decisions. We present a mechanistic movement model of an animal with a limited perceptual range and basic information storage capacities. This `spatially informed forager' constructs an internal map of its environment by using perception, memory and learned or evolutionarily acquired assumptions about landscape attributes. We analyse resulting movement patterns and search efficiencies and compare them to area restricted search strategies (ARS) and biased correlated random walks (BCRW) of omniscient individuals. We show that, in spite of their limited perceptual range, spatially informed individuals boost their foraging success and may perform much better than the best ARS. The construction of an internal map and the use of spatial information results in the emergence of a highly correlated walk between patches and a rather systematic search within resource clusters. Furthermore, the resulting movement patterns may include foray search behaviour. Our work highlights the strength of mechanistic modelling approaches and sets the stage for the development of more sophisticated models of memory use for movement decisions and dispersal.},

A good representation of the collective motions requires a good approximation of the covariances between the fluctuations of the individual atoms. Nevertheless, most studies have validated such models only by the magnitudes of the single-atom fluctuations they predict. In the present study, we have quantified the agreement between the covariance structure predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and those predicted by a representative selection of proposed coarse-grained ENMs. We then contrast this approach with the comparison to MD-predicted atomic fluctuations and comparison to crystallographic B-factors. While all the ENMs yield approximations to the MD-predicted covariance structure, we report large and consistent differences between proposed models.

In contrast, we find that the models that agree best with B-factors model collective motions less reliably and recommend against using B-factors as a benchmark.},

  abstract = {The diffusion rate of lipids in the cell membrane is reduced by a factor of 5--100 from that in artificial bilayers. This slowing mechanism has puzzled cell biologists for the last 25 yr. Here we address this issue by studying the movement of unsaturated phospholipids in rat kidney fibroblasts at the single molecule level at the temporal resolution of 25 {$\mu$}s. The cell membrane was found to be compartmentalized: phospholipids are confined within 230-nm-diameter ({$\phi$}) compartments for 11 ms on average before hopping to adjacent compartments. These 230-nm compartments exist within greater 750-nm-{$\phi$} compartments where these phospholipids are confined for 0.33 s on average. The diffusion rate within 230-nm compartments is 5.4 {$\mu$}m2/s, which is nearly as fast as that in large unilamellar vesicles, indicating that the diffusion in the cell membrane is reduced not because diffusion per se is slow, but because the cell membrane is compartmentalized with regard to lateral diffusion of phospholipids. Such compartmentalization depends on the actin-based membrane skeleton, but not on the extracellular matrix, extracellular domains of membrane proteins, or cholesterol-enriched rafts. We propose that various transmembrane proteins anchored to the actin-based membrane skeleton meshwork act as rows of pickets that temporarily confine phospholipids.},

Proposed models include entrapment in nanoscale noncontiguous domains found in PtK2 cells, slow diffusion due to crowding, and actin-induced compartmentalization. Here, by applying single-particle tracking at high time resolutions, mainly to the PtK2-cell PM, we found confined diffusion plus hop movements (termed ``hop diffusion'') for both a nonraft phospholipid and a transmembrane protein, transferrin receptor, and equal compartment sizes for these two molecules in all five of the cell lines used here (actual sizes were cell dependent), even after treatment with actin-modulating drugs. The cross-section size and the cytoplasmic domain size both affected the hop frequency. Electron tomography identified the actin-based membrane skeleton (MSK) located within 8.8 nm from the PM cytoplasmic surface of PtK2 cells and demonstrated that the MSK mesh size was the same as the compartment size for PM molecular diffusion. The extracellular matrix and extracellular domains of membrane proteins were not involved in hop diffusion. These results support a model of anchored TM-protein pickets lining actin-based MSK as a major mechanism for regulating diffusion.},

Due to the high level of accessibility, immersive interface and ease at which money can be spent, concerns have been expressed that Internet gambling may increase rates of disordered gambling. The current paper aimed to provide an overview of the research to date as well as highlight new and interesting findings relevant to Internet gambling addiction. A comprehensive review of the existing literature was conducted to provide an overview of significant trends and developments in research that relates to disordered Internet gambling.

  abstract = {Chemical reactions can be modeled by a random time-changed Poisson process on countable states. The macroscopic behaviors, such as large fluctuations, can be studied via the WKB reformulation. The WKB reformulation for the backward equation is Varadhan's discrete nonlinear semigroup and is also a monotone scheme that approximates the limiting first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations (HJE). The discrete Hamiltonian is an m-accretive operator, which generates a nonlinear semigroup on countable grids and justifies the well-posedness of the chemical master equation (CME) and the backward equation with 'no reaction' boundary conditions. The convergence from the monotone schemes to the viscosity solution of HJE is proved by constructing barriers to overcome the polynomial growth coefficients in the Hamiltonian. This implies the convergence of Varadhan's discrete nonlinear semigroup to the continuous Lax-Oleinik semigroup and leads to the large deviation principle for the chemical reaction process at any single time. Consequently, the macroscopic mean-field limit reaction rate equation is recovered with a concentration rate estimate. Furthermore, we establish the convergence from a reversible invariant measure to an upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of the stationary HJE.},

Through a one-dimensional irreversible diffusion process on a torus, we explicitly characterize essential concepts in the weak KAM theory, such as the Peierls barrier and the projected Mather/Aubry/Man\texttildelow\textasciiacute e sets. The weak KAM representation of Freidlin-Wentzell's variational construction of the rate function is discussed based on the global adjustment for the boundary data on the Aubry set and the local trimming from the lifted Peierls barriers. This rate function gives the maximal Lipschitz continuous viscosity solution to the corresponding stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE), satisfying Freidlin-Wentzell's variational formula for the boundary data. Choosing meaningful selfconsistent boundary data at each local attractor are essential to select a unique weak KAM solution to stationary HJE. This selected viscosity solution also serves as the global energy landscape of the original stochastic process. This selection for stationary HJEs can be described by first taking the long time limit and then taking the zero noise limit, which also provides a special construction of vanishing viscosity approximation.},

This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, \$N\$ fermions in zero dimensions with strong \$q\$-body interactions coupled to a Markovian bath. For \$q = 4, 8, \textbackslash ldots\$ and certain choices of \$N\$ and bath details, involving pseudo-Hermiticity, we find a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, the Liouvillian has purely real modes for any coupling to the bath. Some of them are demonstrated to be topological by an explicit calculation of the spectral flow, leading to a symmetry-dependent topological index \$\textbackslash nu\$. Topological properties have universal features: they are robust to changes in the Liouvillian provided that the symmetries are respected and they are also observed if the SYK model is replaced by a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain in the same symmetry class. Moreover, the topological symmetry class can be robustly characterized by the level statistics of the corresponding random matrix ensemble. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.},

  abstract = {Microtubules are dynamic filaments whose ends alternate between periods of slow growth and rapid shortening as they explore intracellular space and move organelles. A key question is how regulatory proteins modulate catastrophe, the conversion from growth to shortening. To study this process, we reconstituted microtubule dynamics in the absence and presence of the kinesin-8 Kip3 and the kinesin-13 MCAK. Surprisingly, we found that, even in the absence of the kinesins, the microtubule catastrophe frequency depends on the age of the microtubule, indicating that catastrophe is a multistep process. Kip3 slowed microtubule growth in a length-dependent manner and increased the rate of aging. In contrast, MCAK eliminated the aging process. Thus, both kinesins are catastrophe factors; Kip3 mediates fine control of microtubule length by narrowing the distribution of maximum lengths prior to catastrophe, whereas MCAK promotes rapid restructuring of the microtubule cytoskeleton by making catastrophe a first-order random process.},

Using a hypercubic lattice, we redefine the basic Monte Carlo moves, including the transition probabilities and the corresponding time durations, in order to allow simultaneous jumps along all Cartesian axes.

  abstract = {The Morris Water Maze is a widely used task in studies of spatial learning with rodents. Classical performance measures of animals in the Morris Water Maze include the escape latency and the cumulative distance to the platform. Other methods focus on classifying trajectory patterns to stereotypical classes representing different animal strategies. However, these approaches typically consider trajectories as a whole and as a consequence they assign one full trajectory to one class, whereas animals often switch between these strategies and their corresponding classes, within a single trial. To this end, we take a different approach: we look for segments of diverse animal behaviour within one trial and employ a semi-automated classification method for identifying the various strategies exhibited by the animals within a trial. Our method allows us to reveal significant and systematic differences in the exploration strategies of two animal groups (stressed, non-stressed), that would be unobserved by earlier methods.},

  abstract = {Analytical (rational) mechanics is the mathematical structure of Newtonian deterministic dynamics developed by D'Alembert, Langrange, Hamilton, Jacobi, and many other luminaries of applied mathematics. Diffusion as a stochastic process of an overdamped individual particle immersed in a fluid, initiated by Einstein, Smoluchowski, Langevin and Wiener, has no momentum since its path is nowhere differentiable. In this exposition, we illustrate how analytical mechanics arises in stochastic dynamics from a randomly perturbed ordinary differential equation \$dX\_t=b(X\_t)dt+\textbackslash epsilon dW\_t\$ where \$W\_t\$ is a Brownian motion. In the limit of vanishingly small \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, the solution to the stochastic differential equation other than \$\textbackslash dot\textbraceleft x\textbraceright =b(x)\$ are all rare events. However, conditioned on an occurence of such an event, the most probable trajectory of the stochastic motion is the solution to Lagrangian mechanics with \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft L\textbraceright =\textbackslash\textbar\textbackslash dot\textbraceleft q\textbraceright -b(q)\textbackslash\textbar\textasciicircum 2/4\$ and Hamiltonian equations with \$H(p,q)=\textbackslash\textbar p\textbackslash\textbar\textasciicircum 2+b(q)\textbackslash cdot p\$. Hamiltonian conservation law implies that the most probable trajectory for a "rare" event has a uniform "excess kinetic energy" along its path. Rare events can also be characterized by the principle of large deviations which expresses the probability density function for \$X\_t\$ as \$f(x,t)=e\textasciicircum\textbraceleft -u(x,t)/\textbackslash epsilon\textbraceright\$, where \$u(x,t)\$ is called a large-deviation rate function which satisfies the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. An irreversible diffusion process with \$\textbackslash nabla\textbackslash times b\textbackslash neq 0\$ corresponds to a Newtonian system with a Lorentz force \$\textbackslash ddot\textbraceleft q\textbraceright =(\textbackslash nabla\textbackslash times b)\textbackslash times \textbackslash dot\textbraceleft q\textbraceright +1/2\textbackslash nabla\textbackslash\textbar b\textbackslash\textbar\textasciicircum 2\$. The connection between stochastic motion and analytical mechanics can be explored in terms of various techniques of applied mathematics, for example, singular perturbations, viscosity solutions, and integrable systems.},

In particular, we analyse how the strength of the tracer--obstacle interactions and the volume occupancy of the crowders alter the diffusive motion of the tracer. From the details of partitioning of the tracer diffusion modes between trapping states when bound to obstacles and bulk diffusion, we examine the degree of localisation of the tracer in the lattice of crowders. We study the properties of the tracer diffusion in terms of the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements, the trapping time distributions, the amplitude variation of the time averaged mean squared displacements, and the non-Gaussianity parameter of the diffusing tracer. We conclude that tracer--obstacle adsorption and binding triggers a transient anomalous diffusion. From a very narrow spread of recorded individual time averaged trajectories we exclude continuous type random walk processes as the underlying physical model of the tracer diffusion in our system. For moderate tracer--crowder attraction the motion is found to be fully ergodic, while at stronger attraction strength a transient disparity between ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements occurs. We also put our results into perspective with findings from experimental single-particle tracking and simulations of the diffusion of tagged tracers in dense crowded suspensions. Our results have implications for the diffusion, transport, and spreading of chemical components in highly crowded environments inside living cells and other structured liquids.},

Motivated by recent experiments we report results of extensive simulations of the motion of a finite sized tracer particle in a heterogeneously crowded environment made up of quenched distributions of monodisperse crowders of varying sizes in finite circular two-dimensional domains. For given spatial distributions of monodisperse crowders we demonstrate how anomalous diffusion with strongly non-Gaussian features arises in this model system. We investigate both biologically relevant situations of particles released either at the surface of an inner domain or at the outer boundary, exhibiting distinctly different features of the observed anomalous diffusion for heterogeneous distributions of crowders. Specifically we reveal an asymmetric spreading of tracers even at moderate crowding. In addition to the mean squared displacement (MSD) and local diffusion exponent we investigate the magnitude and the amplitude scatter of the time averaged MSD of individual tracer trajectories, the non-Gaussianity parameter, and the van Hove correlation function. We also quantify how the average tracer diffusivity varies with the position in the domain with a heterogeneous radial distribution of crowders and examine the behaviour of the survival probability and the dynamics of the tracer survival probability. Inter alia, the systems we investigate are related to the passive transport of lipid molecules and proteins in two-dimensional crowded membranes or the motion in colloidal solutions or emulsions in effectively two-dimensional geometries, as well as inside supercrowded, surface adhered cells.},

  abstract = {A lattice random walk is a mathematical representation of movement through random steps on a lattice at discrete times. It is commonly referred to as P\'olya's walk when the steps occur in either of the nearest-neighbor sites. Since Smoluchowski's 1906 derivation of the spatiotemporal dependence of the walk occupation probability in an unbounded one-dimensional lattice, discrete random walks and their continuous counterpart, Brownian walks, have developed over the course of a century into a vast and versatile area of knowledge. Lattice random walks are now routinely employed to study stochastic processes across scales, dimensions, and disciplines, from the one-dimensional search of proteins along a DNA strand and the two-dimensional roaming of bacteria in a petri dish, to the three-dimensional motion of macromolecules inside cells and the spatial coverage of multiple robots in a disaster area. In these realistic scenarios, when the randomly moving object is constrained to remain within a finite domain, confined lattice random walks represent a powerful modeling tool. Somewhat surprisingly, and differently from Brownian walks, the spatiotemporal dependence of the confined lattice walk probability has been accessible mainly via computational techniques, and finding its analytic description has remained an open problem. Making use of a set of analytic combinatorics identities with Chebyshev polynomials, I develop a hierarchical dimensionality reduction to find the exact space and time dependence of the occupation probability for confined P\'olya's walks in arbitrary dimensions with reflective, periodic, absorbing, and mixed (reflective and absorbing) boundary conditions along each direction. The probability expressions allow one to construct the time dependence of derived quantities, explicitly in one dimension and via an integration in higher dimensions, such as the first-passage probability to a single target, return probability, average number of distinct sites visited, and absorption probability with imperfect traps. Exact mean first-passage time formulas to a single target in arbitrary dimensions are also presented. These formulas allow one to extend the so-called discrete pseudo-Green function formalism, employed to determine analytically mean first-passage time, with reflecting and periodic boundaries, and a wealth of other related quantities, to arbitrary dimensions. For multiple targets, I introduce a procedure to construct the time dependence of the first-passage probability to one of many targets. Reduction of the occupation probability expressions to the continuous time limit, the so-called continuous time random walk, and to the space-time continuous limit is also presented.},

  abstract = {A long historical tradition exists among mathematicians, biologists and theoretical ecologists on the topic of quantifying, up-scaling and modelling the statistical properties of animal movement. Nevertheless, new paradigms and technical challenges have recently pervaded the field, attracting renewed interest, as evidenced by the large body of literature on the topic, and by the recent series of international workshops and conferences on the ecology of animal movement(). As the need of new approaches to study movement and search aspects of behavioural ecology is becoming increasingly evident, we identify those cross-disciplinary concepts and ideas that have been burgeoning over the last few years which have the potential to drive fundamental advances in animal movement research. Three factors can be recognized as the genesis of the exciting scientific advances that have contributed to where movement research is at present. The first one is the extensive use of experimental devices of lighter weight and higher resolution, such as GPS and bio-loggers (e.g. Cooke et al. 2004; Hays et al. 2006; Wilson \& McMahon 2006; Wilson et al. 2006), which allow recording of the intimate details of animal lives. New computational tools to analyse and understand such details, gathered from a constantly growing number of species, have become a necessity. The second factor, much related to the first one, is the increased awareness of the need of a unifying theory and an integrative paradigm for organism movement (Nathan et al. 2008). A framework that places animal motion as the central theme would help identify and focus the efforts for developing general empirical and analytical tools to fully understand movement patterns. The third factor is the relatively recent interpretation of animal movement with new tools and concepts borrowed from the field of statistical physics, i.e. L\'evy statistics and anomalous diffusion (see the review articles: Montroll \& West 1979; Schlesinger, Zaslavsky \& Klafter 1993; Klafter \& Sokolov 2005), and optimal stochastic search (e.g. Viswanathan et al. 1999; Bartumeus \& Levin 2008). All these aspects have contributed to enrich the biological discussion on the classical topics of animal ecology such as dispersal, optimal foraging theory, landscape behavioural ecology, animal decision-making and learning. These recent developments clearly indicate the presence of a productive platform for theoreticians and empiricists to help each other answer fundamental questions in animal ecology. In this Forum, we discuss how we believe cross-disciplinary efforts should be brought to the fore in trying to move the field forward. We do so by considering the statistical modelling of: (i) animal trajectories, (ii) search strategies, and (iii) behavioural ecology.},

We show some instances in which non-local jump probabilities emerge from the coupling of the motion to the internal degrees of freedom, and how the tuning of one parameter can give rise to sub-, super- and normal diffusion at long times.

  abstract = {Inferring the role of interactions in territorial animals relies upon accurate recordings of the behaviour of neighbouring individuals. Such accurate recordings are rarely available from field studies. As a result, quantification of the interaction mechanisms has often relied upon theoretical approaches, which hitherto have been limited to comparisons of macroscopic population-level predictions from un-tested interaction models. Here we present a quantitative framework that possesses a microscopic testable hypothesis on the mechanism of conspecific avoidance mediated by olfactory signals in the form of scent marks. We find that the key parameters controlling territoriality are two: the average territory size, i.e. the inverse of the population density, and the time span during which animal scent marks remain active. Since permanent monitoring of a territorial border is not possible, scent marks need to function in the temporary absence of the resident. As chemical signals carried by the scent only last a finite amount of time, each animal needs to revisit territorial boundaries frequently and refresh its own scent marks in order to deter possible intruders. The size of the territory an animal can maintain is thus proportional to the time necessary for an animal to move between its own territorial boundaries. By using an agent-based model to take into account the possible spatio-temporal movement trajectories of individual animals, we show that the emerging territories are the result of a form of collective animal movement where, different to shoaling, flocking or herding, interactions are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The applicability of our hypothesis has been tested with a prototypical territorial animal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).},

  abstract = {Collective animal behavior studies have led the way in developing models that account for a large number of individuals, but mostly have considered situations in which alignment and attraction play a key role, such as in schooling and flocking. By quantifying how animals react to one another's presence, when interaction is via conspecific avoidance rather than alignment or attraction, we present a mechanistic insight that enables us to link individual behavior and space use patterns. As animals respond to both current and past positions of their neighbors, the assumption that the relative location of individuals is statistically and history independent is not tenable, underscoring the limitations of traditional space use studies. We move beyond that assumption by constructing a framework to analyze spatial segregation of mobile animals when neighbor proximity may elicit a retreat, and by linking conspecific encounter rate to history-dependent avoidance behavior. Our approach rests on the knowledge that animals communicate by modifying the environment in which they live, providing a method to analyze social cohesion as stigmergy, a form of mediated animal-animal interaction. By considering a population of animals that mark the terrain as they move, we predict how the spatiotemporal patterns that emerge depend on the degree of stigmergy of the interaction processes. We find in particular that nonlocal decision rules may generate a nonmonotonic dependence of the animal encounter rate as a function of the tendency to retreat from locations recently visited by other conspecifics, which has fundamental implications for epidemic disease spread and animal sociality.},

In one case, the walker is subject to a deterministic bias towards the focal point, while in the other case, it resets its position to the focal point at random times. The deterministic tendency of the biased walker makes the forays away from the focal point more unlikely when compared to the random nature of the returns of the resetting walker. This difference has consequences on the spatio-temporal dynamics at intermediate times. To show the differences in the two models, we analyze their probability distribution and their dynamics in presence and absence of partially or fully absorbing traps. We derive analytically various quantities: (i) mean first-passage times to one target, where we recover results obtained earlier by a different technique, (ii) splitting probabilities to either of two targets as well as survival probabilities when one or either target is partially absorbing. The interplay between confinement, diffusion and absorbing traps produces interesting non-monotonic effects in various quantities, all potentially accessible in experiments. The formalism developed here may have a diverse range of applications, from study of animals roaming within home ranges and of electronic excitations moving in organic crystals to developing efficient search algorithms for locating targets in a crowded environment.},

We review such advances and their formalisms to represent analytically the walker spatio-temporal dynamics in arbitrary dimensions and geometries.

Examples range from the spatial propagation of an infectious pathogen in an animal population to the spread of misinformation in online social networks or the sharing of target locations between robot units in a swarm. Despite the ubiquity of information transfer events, a general methodology to quantify spatio-temporal transmission processes has remained elusive. The challenge in predicting when and where information is passed from one individual to another stems from the limited number of analytic approaches and from the large fluctuations and inherent computational cost of stochastic simulation outputs, the main theoretical tool available to study such processes so far. Here we overcome these limitations by developing an analytic theory of transmission dynamics between randomly moving agents in arbitrary spatial domains and with arbitrary information transfer efficiency. We move beyond well-known approximations employed to study reaction diffusion phenomena, such as the motion and reaction limited regimes, by quantifying exactly the mean reaction time in presence of multiple heterogeneous reactive locations. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our theory we employ it in different scenarios. We show how the type of spatial confinement may change by many orders of magnitude the time scale at which transmission occurs. When acquiring information represents the ability to capture, we use our formalism to uncover counterintuitive evasive strategies in a predator--prey contest between territorial animals. When information transmission represents the transfer of an infectious pathogen, we consider a population with susceptible, infected and recovered individuals that move and pass infection upon meeting and predict analytically the basic reproduction number. Finally we show how to apply the transmission theory semi-analytically when the topology of where individuals move is that of a network.},

Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time-varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak-field limit. Some fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier transform of the time-dependent correlation function of the magnetization at equilibrium.},

The occurrence of occasional large jumps or intermittent patterns combining various types of motion are known to outperform the standard random walk with respect to the MFPT, by reducing oversampling of space. Here we show that a regular but spatially heterogeneous random walk can significantly and universally enhance the search in any spatial dimension. In a generic minimal model we consider a spherically symmetric system comprising two concentric regions with piecewise constant diffusivity. The MFPT is analyzed under the constraint of conserved average dynamics, that is, the spatially averaged diffusivity is kept constant. Our analytical calculations and extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the existence of an optimal heterogeneity minimizing the MFPT to the target. We prove that the MFPT for a random walk is completely dominated by what we term direct trajectories towards the target and reveal a remarkable universality of the spatially heterogeneous search with respect to target size and system dimensionality. In contrast to intermittent strategies, which are most profitable in low spatial dimensions, the spatially inhomogeneous search performs best in higher dimensions. Discussing our results alongside recent experiments on single-particle tracking in living cells, we argue that the observed spatial heterogeneity may be beneficial for cellular signaling processes.},

Here we push the understanding of first passage processes one step further. For a simple heterogeneous system we derive rigorously the complete distribution of first passage times (FPTs). Our results demonstrate that the typical FPT significantly differs from the MFPT, which corresponds to the long time behaviour of the FPT distribution. Conversely, the short time behaviour is shown to correspond to trajectories connecting directly from the initial value to the target. Remarkably, we reveal a previously overlooked third characteristic time scale of the first passage dynamics mirroring brief excursion away from the target.},

During the last few years, it was indeed realized that random walks are a very useful `laboratory' to test the effects of correlations on the record statistics. We start with the simple one-dimensional random walk with symmetric jumps (both continuous and discrete) and discuss in detail the statistics of the number of records, as well as of the ages of the records, i.e. the lapses of time between two successive record breaking events. Then we review the results that were obtained for a wide variety of random walk models, including random walks with a linear drift, continuous time random walks, constrained random walks (like the random walk bridge) and the case of multiple independent random walkers. Finally, we discuss further observables related to records, like the record increments, as well as some questions raised by physical applications of record statistics, like the effects of measurement error and noise.},

  abstract = {Clocks are inherently out-of-equilibrium because, due to friction, they constantly consume free energy to keep track of time. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) quantifies the trade-off between the precision of any time-antisymmetric observable and entropy production. In the context of clocks, the TUR implies that a minimum entropy production is needed in order to achieve a certain level of precision in timekeeping. But the TUR has only been proven for overdamped systems. Recently, a toy model of a classical underdamped pendulum clock was proposed that violated this relation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 130606 (2022)], thus demonstrating that the TUR does not hold for underdamped dynamics. We propose an electronic implementation of such a clock, using a resistor-inductor-capacitor circuit and a biased CMOS inverter (not gate), which can work at different scales. We find that in the nanoscopic single-electron regime of the circuit, we essentially recover the toy model violating the TUR bound. However, in different macroscopic regimes of the circuit, we show that the TUR bound is restored and analyze the thermodynamic efficiency of timekeeping.},

  abstract = {Since 1927 and until recently, most models describing the spread of disease have been of compartmental type, based on the assumption that populations are homogeneous and well-mixed. Recent models have utilised agent-based models and complex networks to explicitly study heterogeneous interaction patterns, but this leads to an increasing computational complexity. Compartmental models are appealing because of their simplicity, but their parameters, especially the transmission rate, are complex and depend on a number of factors, which makes it hard to predict how a change of a single environmental, demographic, or epidemiological factor will affect the population. Therefore, in this contribution we propose a middle ground, utilising crowd-behaviour research to improve compartmental models in crowded situations. We show how both the rate of infection as well as the walking speed depend on the local crowd density around an infected individual. The combined effect is that the rate of infection at a population scale has an analytically tractable non-linear dependency on crowd density. We model the spread of a hypothetical disease in a corridor and compare our new model with a typical compartmental model, which highlights the regime in which current models may not produce credible results.},

In the early nodes implant energies of tens of keV and furnace anneals sufficed. Scaling into the deep submicron regime brought transient enhanced diffusion to the forefront and necessitated its control. This gave rise to rapid thermal annealing and low energy implants. The requirements of current high-performance logic technologies can only be satisfied with careful defect engineering and a further reduction in thermal budget at increased annealing temperatures: flash or laser annealing. Those almost diffusionless anneals make implant precision, such as angle control, imperative. Simultaneously, productivity requirements of implanters add molecular clusters to the list of implant species and lead for certain applications to a switch from beam line to plasma implantation.},

Here we analyze this question within the widely used two-state Brownian ratchet model of kinesin motors based on the continuous-state diffusion along microtubules driven by a flashing binding potential, where the cargo particle is elastically attached to the motor. Depending on the cargo size, the loading force, the amplitude of the binding potential, the turnover frequency of the molecular motor enzyme, and the linker stiffness we demonstrate that the motor transport may turn out either normal or anomalous, as indeed measured experimentally. We show how a highly efficient normal active transport mediated by motors may emerge despite the passive anomalous diffusion of the cargo, and study the intricate effects of the elastic linker. Under different, well specified conditions the microtubule-based motor transport becomes anomalously slow and thus significantly less efficient.},

In this study, we equipped 25 dominant Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) with GPS units to study spatial movement patterns both on land and in water in relation to territory size, resource availability, the number of neighbours, season, and the beavers' age. We show a territory size-dependent trade-off between territorial behaviours and foraging distances: Beavers in larger territories moved greater distances each night, thereby spending more time patrolling, and stayed closer to the shoreline when being on land (i.e. when foraging). Inversely, in smaller territories beavers patrolled less and foraged further away from the shoreline. These results suggest that individuals trade-off the costs of patrolling larger territories against the benefits of foraging closer towards the shoreline. Smaller territories might be more prone to resource depletion, thus, making foraging further from the shoreline a strategy to ensure sustainable resource use. Further, older beavers spent more time on land and close to territory borders compared to younger ones, suggesting a behavioural change with age possibly due to increased experience and boldness.},

[Ann. Math. 160, 433 (2004)], if the most straightforward extrapolation is used. On the other hand, we find that this scaling does hold for the time TN(t)=1(L) at which the average number of yet unvisited sites is 1, as also predicted previously. This might suggest (wrongly) that {$\langle$}Tcover(L){$\rangle$} and TN(t)=1(L) scale differently, although the distribution of rescaled cover times becomes sharp in the limit L{$\rightarrow\infty$}. But our results can be reconciled with those of Dembo et al. by a very slow and nonmonotonic convergence of {$\langle$}Tcover(L){$\rangle$}/(LlnL)2, as had been indeed proven by Belius et al. [Probab. Theory Relat. Fields 167, 461 (2017)] for Brownian walks, and was conjectured by them to hold also for lattice walks.},

  abstract = {We study the extremal properties of a stochastic process x t defined by a Langevin equation , where {$\xi$} t is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean, D 0 is a constant scale factor, and V(B t ) is a stochastic `diffusivity' (noise strength), which itself is a functional of independent Brownian motion B t . We derive exact, compact expressions in one and three dimensions for the probability density functions (PDFs) of the first passage time (FPT) t from a fixed location x 0 to the origin for three different realisations of the stochastic diffusivity: a cut-off case V(B t ) = {$\Theta$}(B t ) (model I), where {$\Theta$}(z) is the Heaviside theta function; a geometric Brownian motion V(B t ) = exp(B t ) (model II); and a case with (model III). We realise that, rather surprisingly, the FPT PDF has exactly the L\'evy--Smirnov form (specific for standard Brownian motion) for model II, which concurrently exhibits a strongly anomalous diffusion. For models I and III either the left or right tails (or both) have a different functional dependence on time as compared to the L\'evy--Smirnov density. In all cases, the PDFs are broad such that already the first moment does not exist. Similar results are obtained in three dimensions for the FPT PDF to an absorbing spherical target.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Animal models are used to study neurobiological mechanisms in mental disorders. Although there has been significant progress in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of threat-related behaviors and anxiety, little progress was made with regard to new or improved treatments for mental disorders. A possible reason for this lack of success is the unknown predictive and cross-species translational validity of animal models used in preclinical studies. Re-translational approaches, therefore, seek to establish cross-species translational validity by identifying behavioral operations shared across species. To this end, we implemented a human open field test in virtual reality and measured behavioral indices derived from animal studies in three experiments (                                                   \$\$\textbackslash textit\textbraceleft N\textbraceright =31\$\$                                                               N                       =                       31                                                                                       ,                                                   \$\$\textbackslash textit\textbraceleft N\textbraceright =30\$\$                                                               N                       =                       30                                                                                       , and                                                   \$\$\textbackslash textit\textbraceleft N\textbraceright =80\$\$                                                               N                       =                       80                                                                                       ). In addition, we investigated the associations between anxious traits and such behaviors. Results indicated a strong similarity in behavior across species, i.e., participants in our study---like rodents in animal studies---preferred to stay in the outer region of the open field, as indexed by multiple behavioral parameters. However, correlational analyses did not clearly indicate that these behaviors were a function of anxious traits of participants. We conclude that the realized virtual open field test is able to elicit thigmotaxis and thus demonstrates cross-species validity of this aspect of the test. Modulatory effects of anxiety on human open field behavior should be examined further by incorporating possible threats in the virtual scenario and/or by examining participants with higher anxiety levels or anxiety disorder patients.},

Here, we review progress in the understanding of microtubule assembly and dynamics, focusing on new information about the structure of microtubule tips. First, we discuss evidence for the widely accepted GTP cap model of microtubule dynamics. Next, we address microtubule dynamic instability in the context of structural information about assembly intermediates at microtubule tips. Three currently discussed models of microtubule assembly and dynamics are reviewed. These are considered in the context of established facts and recent data, which suggest that some long-held views must be re-evaluated. Finally, we review structural observations about the tips of microtubules in cells and describe their implications for understanding the mechanisms of microtubule regulation by associated proteins, by mechanical forces and by microtubule-targeting drugs, prominently including cancer chemotherapeutics.},

In confined geometries, despite notable recent advances, there is to date no general analytical treatment of such imperfect transport-limited reaction kinetics. Here, we determine the kinetics of imperfect reactions in confining domains for any diffusive or anomalously diffusive Markovian transport process, and for different models of imperfect reactivity. We show that the full distribution of reaction times is obtained in the large confining volume limit from the knowledge of the mean reaction time only, which we determine explicitly. This distribution for imperfect reactions is found to be identical to that of perfect reactions upon an appropriate rescaling of parameters, which highlights the robustness of our results. Strikingly, this holds true even in the regime of low reactivity where the mean reaction time is independent of the transport process, and can lead to large fluctuations of the reaction time - even in simple reaction schemes. We illustrate our results for normal diffusion in domains of generic shape, and for anomalous diffusion in complex environments, where our predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.},

To this end, we introduce a parametric approach and consider a piecewise deterministic Markov process modeling both the evolution of the parameter, also called the trait, and the age of infection of individuals over time. At each new infection, a new trait is randomly chosen for the infected individual according to a Markov kernel, and their age is reset to zero. In the large population limit, we derive a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the density of traits and ages. The main goal is to study the conditions under which endemic equilibria exist for the deterministic PDE model and to establish an endemicity threshold that depends on the model parameters. The local stability of these equilibria is also analyzed. The endemicity threshold is computed for several examples, including models that incorporate a vaccination policy, and a local stability result is obtained for a memory-free SIS-type model.},

We show the simultaneous imaging of the outer cell's cytoskeleton and the organelles inside the nucleus. The elastic component of interaction force carries information on the cell's outer elements as the cortex and the actin cytoskeleton.

  abstract = {In this work, we study the dynamics of piecewise smooth (PWS) systems on a codimension-2 transverse intersection of two codimension-1 discontinuity sets. The Filippov convention can be extended to such intersections, but this approach does not provide a unique sliding vector and, as opposed to the classical sliding vector field on codimension-1 discontinuity manifolds, there is no agreed notion of stability in the codimension-2 context. From a modeling perspective, one may interpret this lack of determinacy as a fact that additional modeling is required; knowing the four adjacent vector-fields is not enough to define a unique forward flow. In this paper, we provide additional information to the system by performing a regularization of the PWS system, introducing two regularization functions and a small perturbation parameter. Then, based on singular perturbation theory, we define sliding and stability of sliding through a critical manifold of the singularly perturbed, regularized system. We show that this notion of sliding vector field coincides with the Filippov one. The regularized system gives a parameterized surface, the canopy [M. R. Jeffrey, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 13 (2014), pp. 1082--1105], independent of the regularization functions. This surface serves as our natural basis to derive new and simple geometric criteria on the existence, multiplicity, and stability of the sliding flow, depending only on the smooth vector-fields around the intersection. Interestingly, we are able to show that if there exist two sliding vector-fields, then one is a saddle and the other is of focus/node/center type. This means that there is at most one stable sliding vector field. We then investigate the effect of the choice of the regularization functions, and, using a blowup approach, we demonstrate the mechanisms through which sliding behavior can appear or disappear on the intersection and describe what consequences this has on the dynamics on the adjacent codimension-1 discontinuity sets. This blowup method also shows that the PWS limit of the regularization may be well-defined, even in cases where the Filippov sliding vector field is nonunique. Finally, we show the existence of canard explosions of regularizations of PWS systems in \$\textbackslash mathbb\textbraceleft R\textbraceright\textasciicircum 3\$ that depend on a single unfolding parameter.}

  abstract = {Modern, high-throughput animal tracking increasingly yields `big data' at very fine temporal scales. At these scales, location error can exceed the animal's step size, leading to mis-estimation of behaviours inferred from movement. `Cleaning' the data to reduce location errors is one of the main ways to deal with position uncertainty. Although data cleaning is widely recommended, inclusive, uniform guidance on this crucial step, and on how to organise the cleaning of massive datasets, is relatively scarce. A pipeline for cleaning massive high-throughput datasets must balance ease of use and computationally efficiency, in which location errors are rejected while preserving valid animal movements. Another useful feature of a pre-processing pipeline is efficiently segmenting and clustering location data for statistical methods while also being scalable to large datasets and robust to imperfect sampling. Manual methods being prohibitively time-consuming, and to boost reproducibility, pre-processing pipelines must be automated. We provide guidance on building pipelines for pre-processing high-throughput animal tracking data to prepare it for subsequent analyses. We apply our proposed pipeline to simulated movement data with location errors, and also show how large volumes of cleaned data can be transformed into biologically meaningful `residence patches', for exploratory inference on animal space use. We use tracking data from the Wadden Sea ATLAS system (WATLAS) to show how pre-processing improves its quality, and to verify the usefulness of the residence patch method. Finally, with tracks from Egyptian fruit bats Rousettus aegyptiacus, we demonstrate the pre-processing pipeline and residence patch method in a fully worked out example. To help with fast implementation of standardised methods, we developed the R package atlastools, which we also introduce here. Our pre-processing pipeline and atlastools can be used with any high-throughput animal movement data in which the high data-volume combined with knowledge of the tracked individuals' movement capacity can be used to reduce location errors. atlastools is easy to use for beginners while providing a template for further development. The common use of simple yet robust pre-processing steps promotes standardised methods in the field of movement ecology and leads to better inferences from data.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of intracellular cargo transport from specific sources to target locations is strongly dependent upon molecular motor-assisted motion along the cytoskeleton. Radial transport along microtubules and lateral transport along the filaments of the actin cortex underneath the cell membrane are characteristic for cells with a centrosome. The interplay between the specific cytoskeleton organization and the motor performance results in a spatially inhomogeneous intermittent search strategy. To analyze the efficiency of such intracellular search strategies, we formulate a random velocity model with intermittent arrest states. We evaluate efficiency in terms of mean first passage times for three different, frequently encountered intracellular transport tasks: 1) the narrow escape problem, which emerges during cargo transport to a synapse or other specific region of the cell membrane; 2) the reaction problem, which considers the binding time of two particles within the cell; and 3) the reaction-escape problem, which arises when cargo must be released at a synapse only after pairing with another particle. Our results indicate that cells are able to realize efficient search strategies for various intracellular transport tasks economically through a spatial cytoskeleton organization that involves only a narrow actin cortex rather than a cell body filled with randomly oriented actin filaments.},

  abstract = {Essentially all the biological functions of DNA depend on site-specific DNA-binding proteins finding their targets, and therefore `searching' through megabases of non-target DNA. In this article, we review current understanding of how this sequence searching is done. We review how simple diffusion through solution may be unable to account for the rapid rates of association observed in experiments on some model systems, primarily the Lac repressor. We then present a simplified version of the `facilitated diffusion' model of Berg, Winter and von Hippel, showing how non-specific DNA--protein interactions may account for accelerated targeting, by permitting the protein to sample many binding sites per DNA encounter. We discuss the 1-dimensional `sliding' motion of protein along non-specific DNA, often proposed to be the mechanism of this multiple site sampling, and we discuss the role of short-range diffusive `hopping' motions. We then derive the optimal range of sliding for a few physical situations, including simple models of chromosomes in vivo, showing that a sliding range of {$\sim$}100~bp before dissociation optimizes targeting in vivo. Going beyond first-order binding kinetics, we discuss how processivity, the interaction of a protein with two or more targets on the same DNA, can reveal the extent of sliding and we review recent experiments studying processivity using the restriction enzyme EcoRV. Finally, we discuss how single molecule techniques might be used to study the dynamics of DNA site-specific targeting of proteins.},

The model consists of a system of partial differential equations whose parameters reflect the movement behavior of individuals within each pack and whose steady-state solutions describe the patterns of space-use associated to each pack. By controlling the behavioral parameters in a spatially-dynamic fashion, packs adjust their patterns of movement so as to find a Nash-optimal balance between spreading their territory and avoiding conflict with hostile neighbors. On the mathematical side, we show that solving a nonzero-sum differential game corresponds to finding a non-invasible function-valued trait. From the ecological standpoint, when movement behavior is uncertain, the resulting evolutionarily stable equilibrium gives rise to a buffer-zone, or a no-wolf's land where deer are known to find refuge.},

The dynamics of these processes, approached through a variety of kinetic methods, are discussed. The results obtained for many different enzymes suggest that multiple intermediates and conformations are general characteristics of the catalytic process and allosteric regulation. Ribonuclease, dihydrofolate reductase, chymotrypsin, aspartate aminotransferase, and aspartate transcarbamoylase are considered as specific examples. Typical and maximum rates of conformational changes and catalysis are also discussed, based on results obtained from model systems. The nature and rates of interconversion of the intermediates, along with structural information, can be used as the bases for understanding the incredible catalytic efficiency of enzymes. Potential roles of conformational changes in the catalytic process are discussed in terms of static and environmental effects, and in terms of dynamic coupling within the enzyme-substrate complex.},

  abstract = {The characterization of the dispersal of populations of non-identical individuals is relevant to most ecological and epidemiological processes. In practice, the movement is quantified by observing relatively few individuals, and averaging to estimate the rate of dispersal of the population as a whole. Here, we show that this can lead to serious errors in the predicted movement of the population if the individuals disperse at different rates. We develop a stochastic model for the diffusion of heterogeneous populations, inspired by the movement of the parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita. Direct observations of this nematode in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments reveal a large variation in individual behaviour within the population as reflected initially in the speed of the movement. Further statistical analysis shows that the movement is characterized by temporal correlations and in a heterogeneously structured environment the correlations that occur are of shorter range compared with those in a homogeneous environment. Therefore, by using the first-order correlated random walk techniques, we derive an effective diffusion coefficient for each individual, and show that there is a significant variation in this parameter among the population that follows a gamma distribution. Based on these findings, we build a new dispersal model in which we maintain the classical assumption that individual movement can be described by normal diffusion, but due to the variability in individual dispersal rates, the diffusion coefficient is not constant at the population level and follows a continuous distribution. The conclusions and methodology presented are relevant to any heterogeneous population of individuals with widely different diffusion rates.},

The duality is derived and proven rigorously for both discrete state Markov processes in arbitrary dimension and eectively one-dimensional diusion processes, whereas we also discuss extensions to more complex scenarios. We apply our theory to a simple discrete-state protein folding model and to the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, for which we obtain the exact first passage time distribution analytically in terms of a Newton series of determinants of almost triangular matrices.},

  abstract = {In a finite system driven out of equilibrium by a constant external force the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) bounds the variance of the conjugate current variable by the thermodynamic cost of maintaining the nonequilibrium stationary state. Here we highlight a new facet of the TUR by showing that it also bounds the timescale on which a finite system can exhibit anomalous kinetics. In particular, we demonstrate that the TUR bounds subdiffusion in a single file confined to a ring as well as a dragged Gaussian polymer chain even when detailed balance is satisfied. Conversely, the TUR bounds the onset of superdiffusion in the active comb model. Remarkably, the fluctuations in a comb model evolving from a steady state behave anomalously as soon as detailed balance is broken. Our work establishes a link between stochastic thermodynamics and the field of anomalous dynamics that will fertilize further investigations of thermodynamic consistency of anomalous diffusion models.},

A common use of milestoning is to compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a conformational transition of interest. However, the MFPT is not always the experimentally observed timescale. In particular, the duration of the transition path, or the mean transit time, can be measured in single-molecule experiments, such as studies of polymers translocating through pores and fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies of protein folding. Here we show how to use milestoning to compute transit times and illustrate our approach by applying it to the translocation of a polymer through a narrow pore.},

However, CRW approaches can be used to model more complex animal movement trajectories by assuming individuals move in one of several different behavioural or movement states, each characterized by a different CRW. The spatial and social context an individual experiences may influence the proportion of time spent in different movement states, with subsequent effects on its spatial distribution, survival and fecundity. While methods to study habitat influences on animal movement have been previously developed, social influences have been largely neglected. Here, we fit a 'socially informed' movement model to data from a population of over 100 elk (Cervus canadensis) reintroduced into a new environment, radio-collared and subsequently tracked over a 4-year period. The analysis shows how elk move further when they are solitary than when they are grouped and incur a higher rate of mortality the further they move away from the release area. We use the model to show how the spatial distribution and growth rate of the population depend on the balance of fission and fusion processes governing the group structure of the population. The results are briefly discussed with respect to the design of species reintroduction programmes.},

If the space retains memory of the passage or activity of an individual, animals respond indirectly to one another because interaction is mediated by the environ-ment. This phenomenon, called stigmergy was coined by Pierre-Paul Grass in the '50s to explain nest building in termites. Besides the collective coordination in complex tasks, stig-mergic processes may also serve the purpose of directing individuals towards or away from certain regions of space. Avoidance behaviour, specifically eschewing marks deposited by others, is the behaviour with which territorial patterns of various vertebrates form. Spatial segregation in minimally overlapping regions is accomplished by individuals leaving their own marks wherever they go, while retreating upon encountering foreign ones. Depending on the population density and the time for which the scent remains active after deposition, radically different population patterns may emerge from one extreme with territories that are highly mobile and possess hugely variable shapes to the other extreme with territories that are nearly static and tessellate the terrain in an hexagonal fashion. An analysis of the proper order parameters shows that by increasing population density phase transitions in the spatial arrangement of the territories transform the system from a gas to a liquid and ultimately to a solid.},

Along the way, we obtain new upper bounds on the mixing times of the Glauber dynamics for the Potts model on a general bounded-degree graph, and for the conditional measure of the Curie-Weiss-Potts model near an equilibrium macrostate.},

New chemical systems are responding to the challenge and form the basis for future responsive, adaptive, and active materials.

In particular, we consider an n-dimensional system with a switching manifold in the drift that forms an (n-1)-dimensional hyperplane and investigate noise-induced transitions between metastable states on either side of the switching manifold. To do this, we mollify the drift and use {$\Gamma-$}convergence to derive an appropriate rate functional for the system in the piecewise-smooth limit. The resulting functional consists of the standard Freidlin--Wentzell rate functional, with an additional contribution due to times when the most probable path slides in a crossing region of the switching manifold. We explore implications of the derived functional through two case studies, which exhibit notable phenomena such as non-unique most probable paths and noise-induced sliding in a crossing region.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a large deviation theory developed for functionals of canonical Gibbs processes, i.e., Gibbs processes with respect to the binomial point process. We study the regime of a fixed intensity in a sequence of increasing windows. Our method relies on the traditional large deviation result for local bounded functionals of Poisson point processes noting that the binomial point process is obtained from the Poisson point process by conditioning on the point number. Our main methodological contribution is the development of coupling constructions allowing us to handle delicate and unlikely pathological events. The presented results cover three types of Gibbs models - a model given by a bounded local interaction, a model given by a non-negative possibly unbounded increasing local interaction and the hard-core interaction model. The derived large deviation principle is formulated for the distributions of individual empirical fields driven by canonical Gibbs processes, with its special case being a large deviation principle for local bounded observables of the canonical Gibbs processes. We also consider unbounded non-negative increasing local observables, but the price for treating this more general case is that we only get large-deviation bounds for the tails of such observables. Our primary setting is one with the periodic boundary condition, however, we also discuss generalizations for different choices of the boundary condition.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review The lockdown response to the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted commercial gambling in many jurisdictions around the world. The goal of this review is to systematically identify and describe the survey data and findings to date examining the effect on individual gambling and gambling disorder. Recent findings Of the 17 publications meeting inclusion criteria, the majority reported cross-sectional assessments (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}11, 65\%) and remainder were longitudinal in that they had earlier gambling data for participants (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6, 35\%). Not surprisingly given the closure of land-based gambling, an overall reduction in gambling frequency and expenditure was reported in all studies. The estimate of the proportion of participants in both the general population and the population that gambles who increased overall gambling or online gambling was variable. The most consistent correlates of increased gambling during the lockdown were increased problem gambling severity, younger age groups, and being male. Summary These results suggest that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling and problematic gambling are diverse -- possibly causing a reduction in current or future problems in some, but also promoting increased problematic gambling in others. The longer-term implications of both the reduction in overall gambling, and the increase in some vulnerable groups are unclear, and requires assessment in subsequent follow-up studies. However, in the short term, individuals with existing gambling problems should be recognized as a vulnerable group.},

  abstract = {A ubiquitous observation in cell biology is that the diffusive motion of macromolecules and organelles is anomalous, and a description simply based on the conventional diffusion equation with diffusion constants measured in dilute solution fails. This is commonly attributed to macromolecular crowding in the interior of cells and in cellular membranes, summarizing their densely packed and heterogeneous structures. The most familiar phenomenon is a sublinear, power-law increase of the mean-square displacement (MSD) as a function of the lag time, but there are other manifestations like strongly reduced and time-dependent diffusion coefficients, persistent correlations in time, non-Gaussian distributions of spatial displacements, heterogeneous diffusion and a fraction of immobile particles. After a general introduction to the statistical description of slow, anomalous transport, we summarize some widely used theoretical models: Gaussian models like fractional Brownian motion and Langevin equations for visco-elastic media, the continuous-time random walk model, and the Lorentz model describing obstructed transport in a heterogeneous environment. Particular emphasis is put on the spatio-temporal properties of the transport in terms of two-point correlation functions, dynamic scaling behaviour, and how the models are distinguished by their propagators even if the MSDs are identical. Then, we review the theory underlying commonly applied experimental techniques in the presence of anomalous transport like single-particle tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We report on the large body of recent experimental evidence for anomalous transport in crowded biological media: in cyto- and nucleoplasm as well as in cellular membranes, complemented by in vitro experiments where a variety of model systems mimic physiological crowding conditions. Finally, computer simulations are discussed which play an important role in testing the theoretical models and corroborating the experimental findings. The review is completed by a synthesis of the theoretical and experimental progress identifying open questions for future investigation.},

  abstract = {The cytoskeleton of animal cells is one of the most complicated and functionally versatile structures, involved in processes such as endocytosis, cell division, intra-cellular transport, motility, force transmission, reaction to external forces, adhesion and preservation, and adaptation of cell shape. These functions are mediated by three classical cytoskeletal filament types, as follows: Actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. The named filaments form a network that is highly structured and dynamic, responding to external and internal cues with a quick reorganization that is orchestrated on the time scale of minutes and has to be tightly regulated. Especially in brain tumors, the cytoskeleton plays an important role in spreading and migration of tumor cells. As the cytoskeletal organization and regulation is complex and many-faceted, this review aims to summarize the findings about cytoskeletal filament types, including substructures formed by them, such as lamellipodia, stress fibers, and interactions between intermediate filaments, microtubules and actin. Additionally, crucial regulatory aspects of the cytoskeletal filaments and the formed substructures are discussed and integrated into the concepts of cell motility. Even though little is known about the impact of cytoskeletal alterations on the progress of glioma, a final point discussed will be the impact of established cytoskeletal alterations in the cellular behavior and invasion of glioma.},

Our result not only solves the long-lasting question of the origin of the entropy function in classical irreversible thermodynamics, but also reveals an emergent feature that arises automatically during the deterministic limit, through its large deviation rate function, with both time-reversible dynamics equipped with a Hamiltonian function and time-irreversible dynamics equipped with an entropy function.},

We first rigidly fuse DHRs to HBs to generate a large library of oligomeric building blocks. We then generate assemblies with cyclic, dihedral, and point group symmetries from these building blocks using architecture guided rigid helical fusion with new software named WORMS. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy characterization show that the hierarchical design approach can accurately generate a wide range of assemblies, including a 43\,nm diameter icosahedral nanocage. The computational methods and building block sets described here provide a very general route to de novo designed protein nanomaterials.},

The results are a beginning toward answering some of the theoretical questions presented to population ecologists. The present data indicate that if an adequate environment is encompassed, the predator-prey relation is not necessarily self-annihilative, and that absolutely restrictive refuges are not essential. The results also support the view that more stable control of a population is likely to result in an environment of balanced heterogeneity than in one of simpler structure. In this study a predator-prey relation was maintained for three successive oscillation waves before overexploitation finally ended the relation in the most complex universe or ecosystem utilized. Some of the questions which may ultimately be answered by such studies include: Are such oscillations inherently of increasing amplitude? If so, are there commonly present forces which act to cancel this tendency? Does the presence of other significant species in addition to the two original coactors tend to stabilize or disturb the relation? What may be the effect of changes in the physical conditions upon the degree of stability or permanence of the relation? Can evidence be obtained regarding the concept that the prey, as well as the predator, may benefit from the relation? What is the order of influence on stability of such factors as shelter, food, disease, and natural enemies of other kinds?},

In the current study, we report AXL expression in HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancers where it correlates with poor patient survival. Using murine models of HER2+ breast cancer, Axl, but not its ligand Gas6, was found to be essential for metastasis. We determined that AXL is required for intravasation, extravasation, and growth at the metastatic site. We found that AXL is expressed in HER2+ cancers displaying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures where it contributes to sustain EMT. Interfering with AXL in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) impaired transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$})-induced cell invasion. Last, pharmacological inhibition of AXL specifically decreased the metastatic burden of mice developing HER2+ breast cancer. Our data identify AXL as a potential anti-metastatic co-therapeutic target for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancers.},

  abstract = {We investigate the dynamics and spatial distribution of land use fragmentation in a rapidly urbanizing region of the United States to test key propositions regarding the evolution of sprawl. Using selected pattern metrics and data from 1973 and 2000 for the state of Maryland, we find significant increases in developed and undeveloped land fragmentation but substantial spatial heterogeneity as well. Estimated fragmentation gradients that describe mean fragmentation as a function of distance from urban centers confirm the hypotheses that fragmentation rises and falls with distance and that the point of maximum fragmentation shifted outward over time. However, rather than outward increases in sprawl balanced by development infill, we find substantial and significant increases in mean fragmentation values along the entire urban--rural gradient. These findings are in contrast to the results of Burchfield et al. [Burchfield M, Overman HG, Puga D, Turner MA (2006) Q J Econ 121:587--633], who conclude that the extent of sprawl remained roughly unchanged in the Unites States between 1976 and 1992. As demonstrated here, both the data and pattern measure used in their study are systematically biased against recording low-density residential development, the very land use that we find is most strongly associated with fragmentation. Other results demonstrate the association between exurban growth and increasing fragmentation and the systematic variation of fragmentation with nonurban factors. In particular, proximity to the Chesapeake Bay is negatively associated with fragmentation, suggesting that an attraction effect associated with this natural amenity has concentrated development.},

It predicts two types of mutational hotspots: deletions mediated by homologous recombination and indels caused by replication slippage on simple sequence repeats. We tested the performance of our algorithm on genetic circuits that were previously redesigned for greater evolutionary reliability and analyzed the stability of sequences in the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts. More than half of the parts in the Registry are predicted to experience {$>$}100-fold elevated mutation rates due to the inclusion of unstable sequence configurations. We anticipate that the EFM Calculator will be a useful negative design tool for avoiding volatile DNA encodings, thereby increasing the evolutionary lifetimes of synthetic biology devices.},

An explanation of this is that the diffusivity of the particle itself is changing as a function of time. Models for this diffusing diffusivity have been solved analytically in the limit of small time, but simulations were necessary for intermediate and large times. We show that one of the diffusing diffusivity models is equivalent to Brownian motion in the presence of a sink and introduce a class of models for which it is possible to find analytical solutions. Our solution gives {$\langle$}(x(T))2{$\rangle$} {$\propto$} T for all times and at short times the probability distribution function of the displacement is exponential which crosses over to a Gaussian in the limit of long times and large displacements.},

  abstract = {Microtubules are long filamentous protein structures that randomly alternate between periods of elongation and shortening in a process termed dynamic instability. The average time a microtubule spends in an elongation phase, known as the catastrophe time, is regulated by the biochemical machinery of the cell throughout the cell cycle. In this light, observed changes in the catastrophe time near cellular boundaries (Brunner, D., and P. Nurse. 2000. Cell. 102:695--704; Komarova, Y.A., I.A. Vorobjev, and G.G. Borisy. 2002. J. Cell Sci. 115:3527--3539) may be attributed to regulatory effects of localized proteins. Here, we argue that the pushing force generated by a microtubule when growing against a cellular object may itself provide a regulatory mechanism of the catastrophe time. We observed an up to 20-fold, force-dependent decrease in the catastrophe time when microtubules grown from purified tubulin were polymerizing against microfabricated barriers. Comparison with catastrophe times for microtubules growing freely at different tubulin concentrations leads us to conclude that force reduces the catastrophe time only by limiting the rate of tubulin addition.},

  abstract = {Most studies describing animal movements have been developed in the framework of population dispersion or population dynamics, and have mainly focused on movements in open spaces. During their trips, however, animals are likely to encounter physical heterogeneities that guide their movements and, as a result, influence their spatial distribution. In this paper, we develop a statistical model of individual movement in a bounded space. We introduced cockroaches in a circular arena and quantified accurately the behaviors underlying their movement in a finite space. Close to the edges, we considered that the animals exhibit a linear movement mode with a constant probability per unit time to leave the edge and enter the central zone of the arena. Far from the walls cockroaches were assumed to move according to a diffusive random walk which enabled us to overcome the inherent problem of the quantification of the turning angle distribution. A numerical model implementing the behavioral rules derived from our experiments, confirms that the pattern of the spatial distribution of animals observed can be reliably accounted for by wall-following behaviors combined with a diffusive random walk. The approach developed in this study can be applied to model the movements of animals in various environment under consideration of spatial structure.},

  abstract = {Sharp switches in behaviour, like impacts, stick--slip motion, or electrical relays, can be modelled by differential equations with discontinuities. A discontinuity approximates fine details of a switching process that lie beyond a bulk empirical model. The theory of piecewise-smooth dynamics describes what happens assuming we can solve the system of equations across its discontinuity. What this typically neglects is that effects which are vanishingly small outside the discontinuity can have an arbitrarily large effect at the discontinuity itself. Here we show that such behaviour can be incorporated within the standard theory through nonlinear terms, and these introduce multiple sliding modes. We show that the nonlinear terms persist in more precise models, for example when the discontinuity is smoothed out. The nonlinear sliding can be eliminated, however, if the model contains an irremovable level of unknown error, which provides a criterion for systems to obey the standard Filippov laws for sliding dynamics at a discontinuity.},

  abstract = {Phototaxis in the broadest sense means positive or negative displacement along a light gradient or vector. Prokaryotes most often use a biased random walk strategy, employing type I sensory rhodopsin photoreceptors and two-component signalling to regulate flagellar reversal. This strategy only allows phototaxis along steep light gradients, as found in microbial mats or sediments. Some filamentous cyanobacteria evolved the ability to steer towards a light vector. Even these cyanobacteria, however, can only navigate in two dimensions, gliding on a surface. In contrast, eukaryotes evolved the capacity to follow a light vector in three dimensions in open water. This strategy requires a polarized organism with a stable form, helical swimming with cilia and a shading or focusing body adjacent to a light sensor to allow for discrimination of light direction. Such arrangement and the ability of three-dimensional phototactic navigation evolved at least eight times independently in eukaryotes. The origin of three-dimensional phototaxis often followed a transition from a benthic to a pelagic lifestyle and the acquisition of chloroplasts either via primary or secondary endosymbiosis. Based on our understanding of the mechanism of phototaxis in single-celled eukaryotes and animal larvae, it is possible to define a series of elementary evolutionary steps, each of potential selective advantage, which can lead to pelagic phototactic navigation. We can conclude that it is relatively easy to evolve phototaxis once cell polarity, ciliary swimming and a stable cell shape are present.},

Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of `movement ecology'. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide `mobile links' between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through `equalizing' and `stabilizing' mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.},

Protein crowding has a decisive role in lateral membrane dynamics as shown by recent experimental and computational studies that have reported anomalous lateral diffusion of phospholipids and membrane proteins in crowded lipid membranes. Based on extensive simulations and stochastic modeling of the simulated trajectories, we here investigate in detail how increasing crowding by membrane proteins reshapes the stochastic characteristics of the anomalous lateral diffusion in lipid membranes. We observe that correlated Gaussian processes of the fractional Langevin equation type, identified as the stochastic mechanism behind lipid motion in noncrowded bilayer, no longer adequately describe the lipid and protein motion in crowded but otherwise identical membranes. It turns out that protein crowding gives rise to a multifractal, non-Gaussian, and spatiotemporally heterogeneous anomalous lateral diffusion on time scales from nanoseconds to, at least, tens of microseconds. Our investigation strongly suggests that the macromolecular complexity and spatiotemporal membrane heterogeneity in cellular membranes play critical roles in determining the stochastic nature of the lateral diffusion and, consequently, the associated dynamic phenomena within membranes. Clarifying the exact stochastic mechanism for various kinds of biological membranes is an important step towards a quantitative understanding of numerous intramembrane dynamic phenomena.},

  abstract = {Organismal movement is frequently treated as a diffusion process arising from a simple random walk in a spatially uniform environment. However, anomalous diffusion may arise due to: (1) intrinsic departures from random movements of individuals; or (2) the effects of barriers that impede, or corridors that facilitate, movement. We examine anomalous diffusion in field studies of Eleodes beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and in simulations of correlated random walks on maps of real and artificial landscapes. We show how diffusion alternates between ordinary and anomalous diffusion depending on movement rules, landscape pattern, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Recent theories of diffusion in spatially complex media predict power law relations for anomalous diffusion. Over time scales of 5-500 s, Eleodes exhibited power laws for: (1) mean squared displacement with time; and (2) the mean time to travel from the center to the perimeter of circles of various radii. In grasslands, diffusion exponents changed significantly at a radius of 42 cm, which characterized the size of grass and bare soil patches. A second change in diffusion at scales of 24-600 h characterized home range activity. Marked discrepancies between the dynamics of beetles in the field and in simulations suggest a need for more comprehensive models of individual movement that use different rules for various domains of space and time. Studies of anomalous diffusion identify the relative effects of environment vs. innate behavior and reveal a range of scales over which the effects pertain.}

We describe several theoretical approaches for modeling the diffusion, foraging behavior, and population dynamics of animals in heterogeneous landscapes, including: (1) scaling relationships derived from percolation theory and fractal geometry, (2) extensions of traditional patch-based metapopulation models, and (3) individual-based, spatially explicit models governed by local rules.

The continuous-time model was placed into a state-space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land.

Although the impact of barriers on diadromous fish is well established, impacts on river-resident fish communities remain unclear, especially for low-head barriers. We examined the movement of five contrasting freshwater fish (topmouth gudgeon, European minnow, stone loach, bullhead and brown trout) in an experimental cascade mesocosm with seven pools separated by small vertical barriers. Passage rates differed significantly among species and increased with body size and sustained swimming speed (Usus), ranging from an average of 0.2 passes/hr in topmouth gudgeon to 3.4 passes/hr in brown trout. A random-walk simulation indicated that barriers can result in net downstream movement and shifts in community composition. Passage rates in brown trout were leptokurtic, that is, most individuals were relatively sedentary while a small proportion showed frequent movements. Upstream passage rates of brown trout increased with body length and boldness while fish with lower aerobic scope tended to move downstream. Passage rates showed significant individual repeatability in brown trout, independent of body size, indicating the potential for in-stream barriers to exert selective effects on fish populations. Our results show that barrier effects can be more complex than simply blocking fish passage, and that river-resident fish can be impacted even by very small barriers. We show that fish passage depends on a wide range of morphological, physiological and behavioural drivers, and that barriers can exert selective effects on these traits and cause shifts in community composition. Policy implications. Barrier mitigation measures need to embrace interspecific and intraspecific variation in fish passage to avoid inadvertent artificial selection on fish communities. Given the high abundance of low-head structures in river systems worldwide, a paradigm shift is needed to recognise the subtle impacts of small barriers on freshwater biodiversity. Removal of small barriers or nature-like fishways should allow better passage of the wider fish community compared to widely used salmonid-centric fish passage options.},

Traditional parameterisation techniques, although tedious, have been used extensively to develop CG models for a variety of solvent, soft-matter and biological systems. With the advent of sophisticated optimisation methods, machine learning, and hybrid approaches for force-field parameterisation, models with a higher degree of transferability and accuracy can be developed in a shorter period of time. We review here, some of these traditional and advanced parameterisation techniques while also shedding light on several transferable CG models developed in our group over the years using such an advanced method developed by us. These models, including solvents, polymers and biomolecules have helped us study important solute-solvent interactions and complex polymer architectures, thus paving a way to make experimentally verifiable observations.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

The calculations make possible, in principle, the extraction of confinement parameters such as mean compartment sizes and mean intercompartmental transition rates from experimentally reported published observations. The analysis should be helpful both as an unusual application of effective medium theory and as an investigation of observed molecular movements in cell membranes.},

Drugs can be administered either as suspensions or as solutions and the formulation can range in complexity from a gel or an ointment to a multilayer transdermal patch.

The results demonstrate that thigmotaxis plays a distinct role at different phases of spatial learning. The 1st phase shows a positive correlation between thigmotaxis and general phobic avoidance, whereas there is no association between thigmotaxis and general phobic avoidance during later phases of learning. Furthermore, participants who underperformed in working memory tests and in a spatial construction task exhibited greater thigmotaxis and a higher potential for fear response. Findings are interpreted in the framework of interactions among emotion-, action-, and knowledge-controlled spatial learning theories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

By assuming that movement is a correlated random walk, we derive a formula that relates expected square displacements to the number of consecutive moves. We show this displace-ment formula can be used to highlight the consequences of different searching behaviors (i.e. different probability distributions of turning angles or move lengths). Obser-vations of Pieris rapae (cabbage white butterfly) flight and Battus philenor (pipe-vine swallowtail) crawling are analyzed as a correlated random walk. The formula that we derive aptly predicts that net displacements of ovipositing cabbage white butterflies. In other circum-stances, however, net displacements are not well-described by our correlated random walk formula; in these ex-amples movement must represent a more complicated process than a simple correlated random walk. We suggest that progress might be made by analyzing these more complicated cases in terms of higher order markov processes. 1969). Alternatively, much progress has also been made by describing movement with analytical models that rely on the assumption of random motion (see especially, the pioneering work of Broadbent and Kendall 1953; Skellam 1951). In this paper, we extend an earlier formula concerning discrete random walks (see appendix of Jones 1977) and develop an analytic expression for net displace-ment in a correlated random walk. The formula that we develop fills a gap somewhere between the powerful general diffusion models of Skellam (1951) and the realistic detailed simulations of Jones (1977). One of the advantages of our approach is that it produces a summary of behavior that enables compari-sons to be made between different organisms, or for the same organism in different situations. In particular, by making the assumption of correlated random movement, we derive a formula for expected net displacement in terms of easily observed distance and directionality parameters. This formula can serve as a means for exploring the consequences of varying rules of movement. We illustrate the approach by applying it to two examples of insect movement.}

The spin diffusion constant is calculated with the single approximation of replacing a reduced spin distribution function by its value for local equilibrium with a given inhomogeneous spin density. The behavior of the diffusion constant near the critical point is dominated by a factor {$X-$}1, where {$X$} is the magnetic susceptibility. This problem is also studied with the use of the Bethe lattice. The effects of surrounding spins on the transition probability for spin exchange are found to be essential for obtaining the critical slowing-down near the critical point. In view of this, Koci\'nski's calculation of the spin diffusion constant is critically discussed.},

Thus the local-equilibrium approximation provides an upper bound to the zero-frequency transport coefficient.

However, intact tissue samples naturally exhibit variation in cellular composition, which drives covariation of cell-class-specific molecular features. By analyzing transcriptional covariation in 7,221 intact CNS samples from 840 neurotypical individuals, representing billions of cells, we reveal the core transcriptional identities of major CNS cell classes in humans. By modeling intact CNS transcriptomes as a function of variation in cellular composition, we identify cell-class-specific transcriptional differences in Alzheimer's disease, among brain regions, and between species. Among these, we show that PMP2 is expressed by human but not mouse astrocytes and significantly increases mouse astrocyte size upon ectopic expression in vivo, causing them to more closely resemble their human counterparts. Our work is available as an online resource (http://oldhamlab.ctec.ucsf.edu/) and provides a generalizable strategy for determining the core molecular features of cellular identity in intact biological systems.},

  abstract = {The importance of stochastic processes in relation to problems of population growth was pointed out by W. Feller [1] in 1939. He considered among other examples the "birth-and-death" process in which the expected birth and death rates (per head of population per unit of time) were constants, {$\lambda$}o and {$\mu$}o, say. In this paper, I shall give the complete solution of the equations governing the generalised birth-and-death process in which the birth and death rates {$\lambda$}(t) and {$\mu$}(t) may be any specified functions of the time. The mathematical method employed starts from M. S. Bartlett's idea of replacing the differential-difference equations for the distribution of the population size by a partial differential equation for its generating function. For an account of this technique,1 reference may be made to Bartlett's North Carolina lectures [2]. The formulae obtained lead to an expression for the probability of the ultimate extinction of the population, and to the necessary and sufficient condition for a birth-and-death process to be of "transient" type. For transient processes the distribution of the cumulative population is also considered, but here in general it is not found possible to do more than evaluate its mean and variance as functions of t, although a complete solution (including the determination of the asymptotic form of the distribution as t tends to infinity) is obtained for the simple process in which the birth and death rates are independent of the time. It is shown that a birth-and-death process can be constructed to give an expected population size \$\textbackslash bar n\_t\$ which is any desired function of the time t, and among the many possible solutions the unique one is determined which makes the fluctuation, Var(nt), a minimum for all. The general theory is illustrated with reference of two examples. The first of these is the ({$\lambda$}0, {$\mu$}1t) process introduced by N. Arley [3] in his study of the cascade showers associated with cosmic radiation; here the birth rate is constant and the death rate is a constant multiple of the "age, t, of the process. The \$\textbackslash bar n\_t\$-curve is then Gaussian in form, and the process is always of transient type. The second example is provided by the family of "periodic" processes, in which the birth and death rates are periodic functions of the time t. These appear well adapted to describe the response of population growth (or epidemic spread) to the influence of the seasons.},

Abstract: We develop a fractal method, based on dispersal data, for quantifying the 'degree of clustering' of spat patterns. Clustered spatial patterns are commonly encountered in biology, from local to landscape spatial scales. We b outlining Mandelbrot's 'Levy dust' fractal model for generating spatial point patterns. In this model, a high fractal dim (D = 2) results in a relatively even distribution of points in the plane. Lowering the fractal dimension (D \textbackslash textless 2) generat patterns with increasing levels of clustering at all spatial scales. The Palm intensity method for determining the fractal dim of point patterns is briefly discussed. Next, we note that the distribution function of dispersal distances ('Levy flights Levy dust model is an inverse power function. Since diaspore dispersal curves for higher plants also take the form of an power function, the fractal point pattern dimension D for a given species can be estjmated from a log-log dispersal p apply this method to published dispersal curves. Our results suggest that species with limited diaspore dispersability 2.0, indicating that they occur in the landscape as a colonizing front (a 'phalanx' colonization strategy). Species with s adaptations for potential long-distance dispersal, by contrast, generally have D \textbackslash textless 1 .0. Such species tend to disperse thro landscape as isolated colonists, forming new colonies far from the parent plant (a 'guerilla' colonization strategy).},

  abstract = {Whereas the rest of the treatment in the book has dealt with ordered systems such as crystals, and with disorder that is dynamic, i.e. arising from the movement of the constituents of the crystals, this chapter showed how memory functions arise in statically disordered systems exemplified by amorphous molecular aggregates. We addressed the concept behind the effective medium approach. It was shown how it arises from a judicious and noteworthy application of the defect technique to replace a statically disordered time-local Master equation by an ordered counterpart which is non-local in time. The memory associated with this non-local description was not merely postulated but calculated: an explicit prescription to obtain the memory functions from given probability distributions of the randomness of the disorder was provided and used to examine the extent of validity of the procedure. The typical shape of the EMT memory was determined and an exponential approximation was introduced. Numerical calculations were used to obtain the memory in general as well as in specific cases and a number of effects were discovered with its help. Among others, they included behavior in finite size systems and the appearance of spatially long range memories. A brief conceptual discussion of the method was also provided.},

Concluding Remarks This book provides a graduate-level introduction to three powerful and closely related techniques in condensed matter physics: memory functions, projection operators, and the defect technique. Memory functions appear in the formalism of the generalized master equations that express the time evolution of probabilities via equations non-local in time, projection operators allow the extraction of parts of quantities, such as the diagonal parts of density matrices in statistical mechanics, and the defect technique allows solution of transport equations in which the translational invariance is broken in small regions, such as when crystals are doped with impurities. These three methods combined form an immensely useful toolkit for investigations in such disparate areas of physics as excitation in molecular crystals, sensitized luminescence, charge transport, non-equilibrium statistical physics, vibrational relaxation, granular materials, NMR, and even theoretical ecology. This book explains the three techniques and their interrelated nature, along with plenty of illustrative examples. Graduate students beginning to embark on a research project in condensed matter physics will find this book to be a most fruitful source of theoretical training

The corresponding biased random-walk problem on a finite chain of arbitrary length and with properly terminated ends is solved analytically. The solution is extended to include all continuous-time random walks. (It is thus directly applicable, for instance, to spectral diffusion with asymmetric transfer rates and memory effects.) The diffusivity (and thence the conductivity and relative permittivity) on a chain of N sites is obtained exactly, in closed form. A configuration averaging over N yields the diffusivity and relative permittivity for the randomly interrupted infinite chain. Our analytic results are valid at all frequencies, and are in a form amenable to extensive numerical computation. This is done, and the noteworthy features of the results are displayed graphically. All the known results in the field-free case are recovered as special cases of the expressions presented here.},

  abstract = {We consider discrete and continuous representations of a thermodynamic process in which a random walker (e.g. a molecular motor on a molecular track) uses a periodically pumped energy (work) to pass \$N\$ sites and move energetically downhill while dissipating heat. Interestingly, we find that, starting from a discrete model, the limit in which the motion becomes continuous in space and time (\$N\textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$) is not unique and depends on what physical observables are assumed to be unchanged in the process. In particular, one may (as usually done) choose to keep the speed and diffusion coefficient fixed during this limiting process, in which case the entropy production is affected. In addition, we study also processes in which the entropy production is kept constant as \$N\textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$ at the cost of modified speed or diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we also combine this dynamics with work against an opposing force, which makes it possible to study the effect of discretization of the process on the thermodynamic efficiency of transferring power input to power output. Interestingly, we find that the efficiency is increased in the limit of \$N\textbackslash to\textbackslash infty\$. Finally, we investigate the same process when transitions between sites can only happen at finite time intervals and study the impact of this time discretization on the thermodynamic variables as the continuous limit is approached.},

It is mostly due to the size of protein conformational spaces and required simulation time scales that are still too large to be studied in atomistic detail. Lowering the level of protein representation from all-atom to coarse-grained opens up new possibilities for studying protein systems. In this review we provide an overview of coarse-grained models focusing on their design, including choices of representation, models of energy functions, sampling of conformational space, and applications in the modeling of protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. A more detailed description is given for applications of coarse-grained models suitable for efficient combinations with all-atom simulations in multiscale modeling strategies.},

Integrins must be anchored to the cytoskeleton and bound to extracellular ligands in order to provide firm adhesion, with force transmission across this linkage conferring tissue integrity. Integrin affinity to ligands is highly regulated by cell signaling pathways, altering affinity constants by 1000-fold or more, via a series of long-range conformational transitions. In this review, we first summarize basic, well-known features of integrin conformational states and then focus on new information concerning the impact of mechanical forces on these states and interstate transitions.

Although many methods, both public and commercial, have been developed, the problem of identifying networks of interactions that are most relevant to the given input data still remains an open issue. Here, we have leveraged the method of random walks on graphs as a powerful platform for scoring network components based on simultaneous assessment of the experimental data as well as local network connectivity. Using this method, NetWalk, we can calculate distribution of Edge Flux values associated with each interaction in the network, which reflects the relevance of interactions based on the experimental data. We show that network-based analyses of genomic data are simpler and more accurate using NetWalk than with some of the currently employed methods. We also present NetWalk analysis of microarray gene expression data from MCF7 cells exposed to different doses of doxorubicin, which reveals a switch-like pattern in the p53 regulated network in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our analyses demonstrate the use of NetWalk as a valuable tool in generating high-confidence hypotheses from high-content genomic data.},

Furthermore, {$\langle$}x{$\rangle$} does not depend on the properties of the medium in which it is situated, indicating nonlocality of the process. Starting with an underlying continuous time random walk model we solve diffusion equations describing this problem. Similar drift against flow is found in the quenched trap model.

  abstract = {Intracellular transport of organelles is fundamental to cell function and health. The mounting evidence suggests that this transport is in fact anomalous. However, the reasons for the anomaly is still under debate. We examined experimental trajectories of organelles inside a living cell and propose a mathematical model that describes the previously reported transition from sub-diffusive to super-diffusive motion. In order to explain super-diffusive behaviour at long times, we introduce non-Markovian detachment kinetics of the cargo: the rate of detachment is inversely proportional to the time since the last attachment. Recently, we observed the non-Markovian detachment rate experimentally in eukaryotic cells. Here we further discuss different scenarios of how this effective non-Markovian detachment rate could arise. The non-Markovian model is successful in simultaneously describing the time averaged variance (the time averaged mean squared displacement corrected for directed motion), the mean first passage time of trajectories and the multiple peaks observed in the distributions of cargo velocities. We argue that non-Markovian kinetics could be biologically beneficial compared to the Markovian kinetics commonly used for modelling, by increasing the average distance the cargoes travel when a microtubule is blocked by other filaments. In turn, sub-diffusion allows cargoes to reach neighbouring filaments with higher probability, which promotes active motion along the microtubules.},

  abstract = {Proteins are molecular machines whose function depends on their ability to achieve complex folds with precisely defined structural and dynamic properties. The rational design of proteins from first-principles, or de novo, was once considered to be impossible, but today proteins with a variety of folds and functions have been realized. We review the evolution of the field from its earliest days, placing particular emphasis on how this endeavor has illuminated our understanding of the principles underlying the folding and function of natural proteins, and is informing the design of macromolecules with unprecedented structures and properties. An initial set of milestones in de novo protein design focused on the construction of sequences that folded in water and membranes to adopt folded conformations. The first proteins were designed from first-principles using very simple physical models. As computers became more powerful, the use of the rotamer approximation allowed one to discover amino acid sequences that stabilize the desired fold. As the crystallographic database of protein structures expanded in subsequent years, it became possible to construct proteins by assembling short backbone fragments that frequently recur in Nature. The second set of milestones in de novo design involves the discovery of complex functions. Proteins have been designed to bind a variety of metals, porphyrins, and other cofactors. The design of proteins that catalyze hydrolysis and oxygen-dependent reactions has progressed significantly. However, de novo design of catalysts for energetically demanding reactions, or even proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to highly functionalized complex polar molecules remains an importnant challenge that is now being achieved. Finally, the protein design contributed significantly to our understanding of membrane protein folding and transport of ions across membranes. The area of membrane protein design, or more generally of biomimetic polymers that function in mixed or non-aqueous environments, is now becoming increasingly possible.},

The models dier in the assumptions concerning how the particle is stopped or reflected by the membrane when the particle's attempts to pass through it fail. We show that the Green's functions obtained for both models are equivalent with the exception of the values of these functions at the membranes' surfaces. As examples we present the Green's functions for a membrane system in which subdiusion or slow subdiusion occurs and we briefly discuss the properties of the functions. We also show that the Green's functions can be obtained by means of the generalized method of images. Within this method, the Green's functions appear to be a combination of the Green's functions derived for a homogeneous system without a membrane by means of the rules presented in this paper. Additionally, the obtained Green's functions are used to derive a boundary condition at the membrane. It is shown that the condition contains a specific term which can be interpreted as a `memory term' depending on the kind of diusion occurring in the system which is generated by the membrane.},

  abstract = {We prove Freidlin--Wentzell type large deviation principles for various rescaled models in populations dynamics that have immigration and possibly harvesting: birth--death processes, Galton--Watson trees, epidemic SI models, and prey--predator models. The proofs are carried out using a general analytic approach based on the well-posedness of a class of associated Hamilton--Jacobi equations. The notable feature for these Hamilton--Jacobi equations is that the Hamiltonian can be discontinuous at the boundary. We prove a well-posedness result for a large class of Hamilton--Jacobi equations corresponding to one-dimensional models, and give partial results for the multi-dimensional setting.},

For example, tubulin is activated and deactivated for assembly by a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-driven reaction cycle, and the emerging microtubules catalyze this reaction cycle by changing the microenvironment of the activated tubulin. Recently, synthetic analogs of chemically fueled assemblies have emerged, but examples in which assembly and reaction cycles are reciprocally coupled remain rare. In this work, we report a peptide that can be activated and deactivated for self-assembly. The emerging assemblies change the microenvironment of their building blocks, which consequently accelerate the rates of building block deactivation and reactivation. We quantitatively understand the mechanisms at play, and we are thus able to tune the catalysis by molecular design of the peptide precursor.},

The ultimate goal of a theory of emergence should include using emergence to model, design, or predict the behavior of multiagent systems. The author proposes a formal definition of a basic type of emergence using a language-theoretic and grammar systems approach. It is shown which types of phenomena can be modeled in this sense and what the consequences are for other more complex phenomena.},

Current research in the field is focused on the optimization and improvement in the performance of glucose biosensors by employing a variety of glucose selective enzymes, mediators and semipermeable membranes to improve the electron transfer between the active center of the enzyme and the electrode substrate.

They share a common kinetic mechanism in which two fundamental conformations participate, each receiving and dispatching substrates from its unique side of the membrane. During transport, the cations must pass through their enzyme to cross the membrane and intense interest is currently focused on the possibility that the path which they follow lies within the interface between two discrete subunits in a dimeric structure. Although `half-of-sites' behaviour, consistent with this hypothesis, has been reported, it is now known that systematic errors were responsible for this mistaken conclusion.

To further develop our quantitative insight into cellular transport, we analyze data sets of mRNA molecules fluorescently labeled with MS2-GFP tracked in real time in live Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. As shown previously, these RNA-protein particles exhibit subdiffusive behavior that is viscoelastic in its origin. Examining the ensemble of particle displacements reveals a Laplace distribution at all observed timescales rather than the Gaussian distribution predicted by the central limit theorem. This ensemble non-Gaussian behavior is caused by a combination of an exponential distribution in the time-averaged diffusivities and non-Gaussian behavior of individual trajectories. We show that the non-Gaussian behavior is a consequence of significant heterogeneity between trajectories and dynamic heterogeneity along single trajectories. Informed by theory and simulation, our work provides an in-depth analysis of the complex diffusive behavior of RNA-protein particles in live cells.},

Recently, cases in which gene kissing has an important role in transcriptional regulation have been reported.Recent technological advances have allowed the large-scale identification of interacting loci. Initial results indicate that gene--gene interactions are driven in large part by the surrounding chromatin features (for example, transcriptional activity, histone code and gene content), rather than by a specific gene function being shared by the interacting partners.},

Here we explore the possibility of designing switchable protein systems de novo, through the modulation of competing inter- and intramolecular interactions. We design a static, five-helix `cage' with a single interface that can interact either intramolecularly with a terminal `latch' helix or intermolecularly with a peptide `key'. Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe orthogonal cage--key systems that function in vitro, in yeast and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of function by key. The ability to design switchable protein functions that are controlled by induced conformational change is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering.},

  abstract = {Oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a common event, driving aggressive tumor growth, drug resistance and shorter survival. Currently, the impact of nonchromosomal oncogene inheritance---random identity by descent---is poorly understood. Also unclear is the impact of ecDNA on somatic variation and selection. Here integrating theoretical models of random segregation, unbiased image analysis, CRISPR-based ecDNA tagging with live-cell imaging and CRISPR-C, we demonstrate that random ecDNA inheritance results in extensive intratumoral ecDNA copy number heterogeneity and rapid adaptation to metabolic stress and targeted treatment. Observed ecDNAs benefit host cell survival or growth and can change within a single cell cycle. ecDNA inheritance can predict, a priori, some of the aggressive features of ecDNA-containing cancers. These properties are facilitated by the ability of ecDNA to rapidly adapt genomes in a way that is not possible through chromosomal oncogene amplification. These results show how the nonchromosomal random inheritance pattern of ecDNA contributes to poor outcomes for patients with cancer.},

  abstract = {Most biochemical reactions in living cells rely on diffusive search for target molecules or regions in a heterogeneous overcrowded cytoplasmic medium. Rapid rearrangements of the medium constantly change the effective diffusivity felt locally by a diffusing particle and thus impact the distribution of the first-passage time to a reaction event. Here, we investigate the effect of these dynamic spatiotemporal heterogeneities onto diffusion-limited reactions. We describe a general mathematical framework to translate many results for ordinary homogeneous Brownian motion to heterogeneous diffusion. In particular, we derive the probability density of the first-passage time to a reaction event and show how the dynamic disorder broadens the distribution and increases the likelihood of both short and long trajectories to reactive targets. While the disorder slows down reaction kinetics on average, its dynamic character is beneficial for a faster search and realization of an individual reaction event triggered by a single molecule.},

The toolbox is general, robust, easy to use, and does not rely on any underlying microscopic model. As a proof of concept we apply it to the analysis of memory in the dynamics of the end-to-end distance of the analytically solvable Rouse-polymer model, an experimental time series of extensions of a single DNA hairpin measured by optical tweezers, and the fraction of native contacts in a small protein probed by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Chemical reaction networks offer a natural nonlinear generalisation of linear Markov jump processes on a finite state-space. In this paper, we analyse the dynamical large deviations of such models, starting from their microscopic version, the chemical master equation. By taking a large-volume limit, we show that those systems can be described by a path integral formalism over a Lagrangian functional of concentrations and chemical fluxes. This Lagrangian is dual to a Hamiltonian, whose trajectories correspond to the most likely evolution of the system given its boundary conditions. The same can be done for a system biased on time-averaged concentrations and currents, yielding a biased Hamiltonian whose trajectories are optimal paths conditioned on those observables. The appropriate boundary conditions turn out to be mixed, so that, in the long time limit, those trajectories converge to well-defined attractors. We are then able to identify the largest value that the Hamiltonian takes over those attractors with the scaled cumulant generating function of our observables, providing a non-linear equivalent to the well-known Donsker-Varadhan formula for jump processes. On that basis, we prove that chemical reaction networks that are deterministically multistable generically undergo first-order dynamical phase transitions in the vicinity of zero bias. We illustrate that fact through a simple bistable model called the Schl\textbackslash "ogl model, as well as multistable and unstable generalisations of it, and we make a few surprising observations regarding the stability of deterministic fixed points, and the breaking of ergodicity in the large-volume limit.},

The central tools for estimating convergence times, including coupling, strong stationary times, and spectral methods, are developed. The authors discuss many examples, including card shuffling and the Ising model, from statistical mechanics, and present the connection of random walks to electrical networks and apply it to estimate hitting and cover times.  The first edition has been used in courses in mathematics and computer science departments of numerous universities. The second edition features three new chapters (on monotone chains, the exclusion process, and stationary times) and also includes smaller additions and corrections throughout. Updated notes at the end of each chapter inform the reader of recent research developments.},

Model results reflect field observations from northeastern Minnesota: buffer zones where wolves are scarce arise between adjacent packs, and near these buffer zones there are increased levels of scent marking1,2. Territories are arranged in a spatial mosaic (Fig. 1) which covers the wolf range. In the model formulation no assumptions are made about actual existence or extent of wolf territory and buffer zones; these arise naturally as stable steady-state solutions to the equations. We show mathematically how reduced predation by wolves in the buffer zones provides a refuge for prey species. Field studies support this; distribution of a primary prey species, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), correlates negatively with that of wolves. Deer are found primarily in buffer zones3,4 (Fig. 2).},

  abstract = {Recent experiments in cell biology have probed the impact of artificially-induced intracellular flows in the spatiotemporal organisation of cells and organisms. In these experiments, mild dynamical heating via focused infrared light from a laser leads to long-range, thermoviscous flows of the cytoplasm inside a cell, a method popularised in cell biology as FLUCS (focused-light-induced cytoplasmic streaming). Here, we present a fully analytical, theoretical model describing the fluid flow and transport of tracers induced by the laser at all length scales in two-dimensional confinement. The focused light causes a small, local temperature change, which in turn results in a small change in the density and viscosity of the fluid locally. We analytically solve for the instantaneous flow field due to the translation of a heat spot of arbitrary time-dependent amplitude along a scan path. We show that the leading-order instantaneous flow results purely from thermal expansion. It is proportional to the magnitude of the temperature perturbation, with far-field behaviour typically dominated by a source or sink flow and proportional to the rate of change of the heat-spot amplitude. In contrast, and in agreement with experimental measurements, the net displacement of a tracer due to a full scan of the heat spot is quadratic in the heat-spot amplitude, as it results from the interplay of thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes. The corresponding average velocity of tracers over a scan is a hydrodynamic source dipole in the far field, with direction dependent on the relative importance of thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes. Our quantitative findings show excellent agreement with recent experimental results and will enable the design of new controlled experiments to establish the physiological role of physical transport processes inside cells.},

Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the N -particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the N -particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the N -particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.},

  abstract = {Ankyrin repeat, one of the most widely existing protein motifs in nature, consists of 30-34 amino acid residues and exclusively functions to mediate protein-protein interactions, some of which are directly involved in the development of human cancer and other diseases. Each ankyrin repeat exhibits a helix-turn-helix conformation, and strings of such tandem repeats are packed in a nearly linear array to form helix-turn-helix bundles with relatively flexible loops. The global structure of an ankyrin repeat protein is mainly stabilized by intra- and inter-repeat hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. The repetitive and elongated nature of ankyrin repeat proteins provides the molecular bases of the unique characteristics of ankyrin repeat proteins in protein stability, folding and unfolding, and binding specificity. Recent studies have demonstrated that ankyrin repeat proteins do not recognize specific sequences, and interacting residues are discontinuously dispersed into the whole molecules of both the ankyrin repeat protein and its partner. In addition, the availability of thousands of ankyrin repeat sequences has made it feasible to use rational design to modify the specificity and stability of physiologically important ankyrin repeat proteins and even to generate ankyrin repeat proteins with novel functions through combinatorial chemistry approaches.},

  abstract = {Processes involving concentrations (or finite numbers) of particles moving randomly in space and reacting either upon encounter or via distance-dependent reaction rates are ubiquitous in condensed matter physics. Some of the many examples are recombination of ions or holes and electrons, excitation energy migration and quenching, trapping of particles by other species, in energy minima of random potential landscapes or in dangling ends of complex structures, coagulation, polymerization, and growth of dendrites or nuclei of a new phase. These processes have been studied for a long time and descriptions of their kinetic behaviour can be found in virtually every textbook on chemical physics. The conventional textbook picture is, however, a bit outdated being based on mean-field approaches that discard fluctuations and many-particle effects. At best, random transport of particles is taken into account in terms of the heuristic renormalization of the reaction rates following the Smoluchowski approach, which is far from adequate. About three decades ago it was realized that in some systems with reactions and random transport, as in many other many-particle systems, many-particle effects and spatial fluctuations play an essential role and result in anomalous behaviour when compared to the standard textbook predictions. This may be, in some instances, fluctuation-induced decay of mean concentrations of particles, anomalously slow approach to equilibrium described by power laws in place of the exponential ones predicted by conventional chemical kinetics. In other cases, chemical equilibrium may not even be a proper thermodynamic equilibrium but rather a steady-state dependent on kinetic parameters. These effects become even more pronounced for reactions taking place in disordered media, open chemical systems with external input of particles or in systems with anomalous diffusion. Within the last three decades much effort has been devoted to the analysis of fluctuation-induced and many-particle phenomena in chemical kinetics. Numerous seminal contributions are, however, scattered among many journals and no attempt has been made so far to present a unified picture. In this special issue on `Chemical kinetics beyond the textbook: fluctuations, many-particle effects and anomalous dynamics' we attempt to present a general overview of different facets of the fluctuation-induced behaviour in systems with reactions and random transport. This special issue comprises 50 seminal works and reviews of many researchers world-wide working on different aspects of fluctuation phenomena in chemical, physical and biophysical systems, both theoretical and experimental. We believe that this special issue will become a point of reference and inspiration for many researchers and wish to thank all the contributing authors for their effort and support of our endeavour.},

The present study considers its impact upon gambling behavior. Particularly, changes in self-reported gambling by Swiss, land-based casino players are examined. The main characteristics of respondents who played or did not play during lockdown are also investigated. This study is embedded in an ongoing longitudinal study that examines the gambling behavior of casino players at three points in time. All respondents who had participated in the first wave of the longitudinal study by the cut-off date (15th March 2020) were asked about their gambling behavior during lockdown in a supplementary online survey three weeks after the end of lockdown. A total of 55\% of the 110 respondents reported having played during lockdown. Gambling intensity significantly decreased (p {$<$} 0.001) in our sample. Considering only those respondents (n = 66) who reported having gambled during lockdown, gambling intensity also decreased (p {$<$} 0.001), but online gambling significantly increased (p {$<$} 0.002). Those players who have increased their gambling activity require particular attention. It is important that casinos respond with appropriate player protection measures to those who have increased their gambling activity during the pandemic.},

We analyze the continuum limit which is approached very slowly, with corrections that vanish logarithmically with the lattice size. We then examine the influence of the shape of the lattice on the first-passage probability, where we focus on the aspect ratio dependence: Distorting the lattice always reduces the encounter probability of two walkers and can exhibit a crossover to the behavior of a genuinely one-dimensional random walk.

  abstract = {Variations in behavioral traits are widely recognized to drive animal behaviors exhibited within a population. However, information on how behavior traits influence behavior in anthropogenically modified habitats is lacking. Many habitats have become highly fragmented as a result of human processes. To mitigate this and improve habitat connectivity, wildlife passes are increasingly employed, with the aim of enabling animals to move freely between habitats. However, wildlife passes (e.g., fishways) are not always effective in achieving passage and it remains uncertain what factors play a role in an individual's likelihood of passing successfully. This study measured three behavioral traits (boldness, exploration, and activity) in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta; n = 78) under field conditions within a river and tested whether these behavior traits influenced both the passage success and the behaviors exhibited during upstream fishway passage attempts. Although behavioral traits were found and collapsed into two behavioral trait dimensions, behavioral traits had low repeatability and so did not contribute to a personality spectrum. Boldness was found to negatively influence the number of passage attempts carried out by an individual and to positively influence passage success, with bolder individuals carrying out fewer attempts and having an increased probability of passage success. No behavioral traits were found to be related to other passage metrics (passage success, Time until First Attempt, and Passage Duration) during the first passage. But all three behavioral traits were significantly negatively related to the changes in passage behaviors at consecutive, successful passage attempts, with bolder, more exploratory and more active individuals passing through a fishway quicker on the second passage than on the first. This study suggests that bolder and more active individuals may perform better during fishway passage attempts, particularly within rivers where multiple barriers to movement exist.},

We found that these elements displayed fractional Langevin motion (fLm) due to the viscoelastic hindrance from the surrounding network of proteins and chromatin fibers. Using fractional Langevin dynamics modeling, we found that, with high probability, DHJH elements reach a VH element within minutes. Spatial confinement emerged as the dominant parameter that determined the frequency of such encounters. We propose that the viscoelastic nature of the nuclear environment causes coding elements and regulatory elements to bounce back and forth in a spring-like fashion until specific genomic interactions are established and that spatial confinement of topological domains largely controls first-passage times for genomic interactions.},

  abstract = {Random perturbations may decisively affect the long-term behavior of dynamical systems. Random effects are modeled by the addition of Gaussian white noise to the system. The resulting diffusion equation is solved asymptotically, when the strength of the noise is small. Such solutions can be found by a ray method. The rays, in turn, can be interpreted as paths of maximum likelihood. The lowest eigenvalue for the system can then be approximated by means of the asymptotic solution of the diffusion equation. The reciprocal of this eigenvalue gives the persistence of the system.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Drug repositioning, which aims to identify new indications for existing drugs, offers a promising alternative to reduce the total time and cost of traditional drug development. Many computational strategies for drug repositioning have been proposed, which are based on similarities among drugs and diseases. Current studies typically use either only drug-related properties (e.g. chemical structures) or only disease-related properties (e.g. phenotypes) to calculate drug or disease similarity, respectively, while not taking into account the influence of known drug-disease association information on the similarity measures. RESULTS: In this article, based on the assumption that similar drugs are normally associated with similar diseases and vice versa, we propose a novel computational method named MBiRW, which utilizes some comprehensive similarity measures and Bi-Random walk (BiRW) algorithm to identify potential novel indications for a given drug. By integrating drug or disease features information with known drug-disease associations, the comprehensive similarity measures are firstly developed to calculate similarity for drugs and diseases. Then drug similarity network and disease similarity network are constructed, and they are incorporated into a heterogeneous network with known drug-disease interactions. Based on the drug-disease heterogeneous network, BiRW algorithm is adopted to predict novel potential drug-disease associations. Computational experiment results from various datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach has reliable prediction performance and outperforms several recent computational drug repositioning approaches. Moreover, case studies of five selected drugs further confirm the superior performance of our method to discover potential indications for drugs practically.

In this work, we investigate the non-Gaussian diffusion in static disordered media via a quenched trap model, where the diffusivity is spatially correlated. Several unique effects due to quenched disorder are reported. We analytically estimate the diffusion coefficient Ddis and its fluctuation over samples of finite size. We show a mechanism of population splitting in the non-Gaussian diffusion. It results in a sharp peak in the distribution of displacement P(x,t) around x=0, that has frequently been observed in experiments. We examine the fidelity of the coarse-grained diffusion map, which is reconstructed from particle trajectories. Finally, we propose a procedure to estimate the correlation length in static disordered environments, where the information stored in the sample-to-sample fluctuation has been utilized.},

  abstract = {In recent years, design of wireless sensor networks using methodologies and mechanisms from other disciplines has gained popularity for addressing many networking aspects and providing more flexible and robust algorithms. We address in this paper the problem of random walk to model routing for data gathering in wireless sensor networks. While at first glance, this approach may seem to be overly simplistic and highly inefficient, many encouraging results that prove its comparability with other approaches have been obtained over the years. In this approach, a packet generated from a given sensor node performs a random motion until reaching a sink node where it is collected. The objective of this paper is to give an analytical model to evaluate the performance of the envisioned routing scheme with special attention to two metrics: the mean system data gathering delay and the induced spatial distribution of energy consumption. The main result shows that this approach achieves acceptable performance for applications without too stringent QoS requirements provided that the ratio of sink nodes over the total number of sensor nodes is carefully tuned.},

The cover time is defined as the time a random walker requires to visit every node in the network at least once. This quantity is particularly important for random search processes and target localization on network structures. Based on the global mean first-passage time of target nodes, we derive a method for computing the cumulative distribution function of the cover time based on first-passage time statistics. Our method is viable for networks on which random walks equilibrate quickly. We show that it can be applied successfully to various model and real-world networks. Our results reveal an intimate link between first-passage and cover time statistics and offer a computationally efficient way for estimating cover times in network-related applications.},

While spatial fluctuations are captured by Lifson-Jackson-Zwanzig's model of "diffusion in a rough potential", and temporal fluctuations are often viewed as leading to additional friction effects, a unified view where the environment fluctuates both in time and in space is currently lacking. Here we introduce a discrete-state model of a landscape fluctuating both in time and in space. Importantly, the model accounts for the back-reaction of the diffusing particle on the landscape. As a result we find, surprisingly, that many features of the observable dynamics do not depend on the temporal fluctuation timescales and are already captured by the model of diffusion in a rough potential, even though this assumes a static energy landscape.},

In the present work, the rFPK equation is solved by using a novel splitting technique, under which it is replaced by a Pfaffian system, which is always solvable, and a scalar equation, which is solved under some restrictions, relating the coefficients of the oscillator with the intensities of excitation noises. Using this technique, stationary solutions are obtained to two classes of stochastic oscillators, generalizing the results of Wang and Zhang [9] and Dimentberg [19]. Finally, the present splitting method is applied to establish a new equivalence class between stochastic oscillators and stochastic differential equations.},

In the framework of the adaptive susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model of Gross et al. [Phys. Rev.

One method to overcome this difficulty is to homogenize the model by replacing the spatially-varying fine-scale diffusivity with an effective diffusivity calculated from the solution of an appropriate boundary value problem. In this paper, we present a new semi-analytical method for solving this boundary value problem and computing the effective diffusivity for pixellated, locally-isotropic, heterogeneous media. We compare our new solution method to a standard finite volume method and show that equivalent accuracy can be achieved in less computational time for several standard test cases. We also demonstrate how the new solution method can be applied to complex heterogeneous geometries represented by a two-dimensional grid of rectangular blocks. These results indicate that our new semi-analytical method has the potential to significantly speed up simulations of diffusion in heterogeneous media.},

  abstract = {Many of the most pervasive disease challenges to livestock are transmitted via oral contact with faeces (or by faecal--aerosol) and the current paper focuses on how disease risk may depend on: spatial heterogeneity, animal searching behaviour, different grazing systems and faecal deposition patterns including those representative of livestock and a range of wildlife. A spatially explicit agent-based model was developed to describe the impact of empirically observed foraging and avoidance behaviours on the risk of disease presented by investigative and grazing contact with both livestock and wildlife faeces. To highlight the role of spatial heterogeneity on disease risks an analogous deterministic model, which ignores spatial heterogeneity and searching behaviour, was compared with the spatially explicit agent-based model. The models were applied to assess disease risks in temperate grazing systems. The results suggest that spatial heterogeneity is crucial in defining the disease risks to which individuals are exposed even at relatively small scales. Interestingly, however, although sensitive to other aspects of behaviour such as faecal avoidance, it was observed that disease risk is insensitive to search distance for typical domestic livestock restricted to small field plots. In contrast disease risk is highly sensitive to distributions of faecal contamination, in that contacts with highly clumped distributions of wildlife contamination are rare in comparison to those with more dispersed contamination. Finally it is argued that the model is a suitable framework to study the relative inter- and intra-specific disease risks posed to livestock under different realistic management regimes.},

Enormous efforts have been put in the mechanistic understanding of diffusion--reaction relationships of nanoporous solids, with the ultimate goal of developing materials with improved catalytic performance. Single-molecule localization microscopy can be used to explore the pore space via the trajectories of individual molecules. This ensemble-free perspective directly reveals heterogeneities in diffusion and diffusion-related reactivity of individual molecules, which would have been obscured in bulk measurements. In this article, we review developments in the spatial and temporal characterization of nanoporous solids using single-molecule localization microscopy. We illustrate various aspects of this approach, and showcase how it can be used to follow molecular diffusion and reaction behaviors in nanoporous solids.},

  abstract = {Exploration of an unknown environment is a fundamental concern in mobile robotics. This paper presents an approach for cooperative multi-robot exploration, fire searching and mapping in an unknown environment. The proposed approach aims to minimize the overall exploration time, making it possible to localize fire sources in an efficient way. In order to achieve this goal, the robots should cooperate in an effective way, so they can individually and simultaneously explore different areas of the environment while they identify fire sources. The proposed approach employs a decentralized frontier based exploration method which evaluates the cost-gain ratio to navigate to target way-points. The target way-points are obtained by an A* search variant algorithm. The potential field method is used to control the robots motion while avoiding obstacles. When a robot detects a fire, it estimates the flame's position by triangulation. The communication between the robots is done in a decentralized control way where they share the necessary data to generate the map of the environment and to perform cooperative actions in a behavioral decision making way. This paper presents simulation and experimental results of the proposed exploration and fire search method and concludes with a discussion of the obtained results and future improvements.},

Analytical solutions are limited to special cases, and resorting to numerical simulation is often the only route available; in high dimensions, or for parametric studies, this can become unwieldy. Using asymptotic techniques, that draw upon the known Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) case, we consider a mean-reverting system and obtain its representation as a product of terms, representing short-term, long-term, and medium-term behaviour. A further reduction yields a simple explicit formula, both intuitive in terms of its physical origin and fast to evaluate. We illustrate a breadth of cases, some of which are `far' from the OU model, such as double-well potentials, and even then, perhaps surprisingly, the approximation still gives very good results when compared with numerical simulations. Both one- and two-dimensional examples are considered.},

  abstract = {Although discrete approaches are increasingly employed to model biological phenomena, it remains unclear how complex, population-level behaviours in such frameworks arise from the rules used to represent interactions between individuals. Discrete-tocontinuum approaches, which are used to derive systems of coarse-grained equations describing the mean-field dynamics of a microscopic model, can provide insight into such emergent behaviour. Coarse-grained models often contain nonlinear terms that depend on the microscopic rules of the discrete framework, however, and such nonlinearities can make a model difficult to mathematically analyse. By contrast, models developed using phenomenological approaches are typically easier to investigate but have a more obscure connection to the underlying microscopic system. To our knowledge, there has been little work done to compare solutions of phenomenological and coarse-grained models. Here we address this problem in the context of angiogenesis (the creation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature). We compare asymptotic solutions of a classical, phenomenological ``snail-trail'' model for angiogenesis to solutions of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations (PDEs) derived via a systematic coarse-graining procedure (Pillay et al. in Phys Rev E 95(1):012410, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.012410). For distinguished parameter regimes corresponding to chemotaxis-dominated cell movement and low branching rates, both continuum models reduce at leading order to identical PDEs within the domain interior. Numerical and analytical results confirm that pointwise differences between solutions to the two continuum models are small if these conditions hold, and demonstrate how perturbation methods can be used to determine when a phenomenological model provides a good approximation to a more detailed coarse-grained system for the same biological process.},

Detailed knowledge of the habitat requirements of this semi-aquatic woodland carabid beetle is needed if effective conservation and management strategies are to be developed. Previous habitat models have proved to be a successful analytical and predictive tool for the conservation of species. We conducted an intensive study over a two year period on two extant C. variolosus populations in Westphalia (Germany) using live capture pitfall traps. We analysed the distribution of the beetles over their main activity period in relation to a large number of edaphic and vegetation variables in order to estimate habitat suitability models and describe optimum ranges. C. variolosus is restricted to the fringes of water bodies and to areas of high soil moisture that display patches of bare soil, shows a slight preference for sparse tree vegetation, and avoids acidic soil. Temporal and spatial transferability of the statistically significant habitat models indicates their robustness and validity. Based on the results of our study, we suggest management measures for the conservation of C. variolosus, which promote the rehabilitation of natural flood plains of headwater areas.},

We illustrate the techniques with examples of insect movement and the vegetative spread of clonal plants.}

A number of sophisticated experimental techniques now allow the behavior of individual types of macromolecule to be studied directly in vivo; none, however, allow a wide range of molecule types to be observed simultaneously. In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and ``snapshots'' of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited ``crowding'' effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.},

  abstract = {In this work we consider a recent experimental data set describing heat conduction in living porcine tissues. Understanding this novel data set is important because porcine skin is similar to human skin. Improving our understanding of heat conduction in living skin is relevant to understanding burn injuries, which are common, painful and can require prolonged and expensive treatment. A key feature of skin is that it is layered, with different thermal properties in different layers. Since the experimental data set involves heat conduction in thin living tissues of anesthetised animals, an important experimental constraint is that the temperature within the living tissue is measured at one spatial location within the layered structure. Our aim is to determine whether this data is sufficient to reliably infer the heat conduction parameters in layered skin, and we use a simplified two-layer mathematical model of heat conduction to mimic the generation of experimental data. Using synthetic data generated at one location in the two-layer mathematical model, we explore whether it is possible to infer values of the thermal diffusivity in both layers. After this initial exploration, we then examine how our ability to infer the thermal diffusivities changes when we vary the location at which the experimental data is recorded, as well as considering the situation where we are able to monitor the temperature at two locations within the layered structure. Overall, we find that our ability to parameterise a model of heterogeneous heat conduction with limited experimental data is very sensitive to the location where data is collected. Our modelling results provide guidance about optimal experimental design that could be used to guide future experimental studies.},

Combining tools from stochastic thermodynamics and large-deviation theory, we develop a powerful theory for computing the large-deviation statistics of such observables. Our method naturally leads to a description in terms of a dynamical Landau theory, a versatile tool for the analysis of finite-time dynamical phase transitions. The topology of the associated Landau potential allows for an unambiguous identification of the dynamical order parameter and of the phase diagram. As an immediate application of our method, we show that the probability distribution of the heat exchanged between a mean-field spin model and the environment exhibits a singular point, a kink, caused by a finite-time dynamical phase transition. Using our Landau theory, we conduct a detailed study of the phase transition. Although the manifestation of the new transition is similar to that of a previously found finite-time transition in the magnetisation, the properties and the dynamical origins of the two turn out to be very different.},

Nevertheless, gambling at casinos and gambling on the Internet are both hugely popular activities. In recent years, both prospect theory and laboratory-controlled experiments have been used to improve our understanding of risk attitudes associated with gambling. Despite theoretical progress, collecting real-life gambling data, which is essential to validate predictions and experimental findings, remains a challenge. To address this issue, we collect publicly available betting data from a DApp (decentralized application) on the Ethereum blockchain, which instantly publishes the outcome of every single bet (consisting of each bet's timestamp, wager, probability of winning, userID and profit). This online casino is a simple dice game that allows gamblers to tune their own winning probabilities. Thus the dataset is well suited for studying gambling strategies and the complex dynamic of risk attitudes involved in betting decisions. We analyse the dataset through the lens of current probability-theoretic models and discover empirical examples of gambling systems. Our results shed light on understanding the role of risk preferences in human financial behaviour and decision-makings beyond gambling.},

  abstract = {Cancer biology involves complex, dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironments. Single-cell effects are critical drivers of clinical progression. Chemical and mechanical communication between tumor and stromal cells can co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer's ability to test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models) simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues, which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models. Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud computing resources make software easier to access and supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new therapeutic strategies, and even re-engineer tumor and stromal cells to bring cancer systems under control.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a generalized Langevin equation-based model to describe the lateral diffusion of a protein in a lipid bilayer. The memory kernel is represented in terms of a viscous (instantaneous) and an elastic (noninstantaneous) component modeled through a Dirac {$\delta$} function and a three-parameter Mittag-Leffler type function, respectively. By imposing a specific relationship between the parameters of the three-parameter Mittag-Leffler function, the different dynamical regimes---namely ballistic, subdiffusive, and Brownian, as well as the crossover from one regime to another---are retrieved. Within this approach, the transition time from the ballistic to the subdiffusive regime and the spectrum of relaxation times underlying the transition from the subdiffusive to the Brownian regime are given. The reliability of the model is tested by comparing the mean-square displacement derived in the framework of this model and the mean-square displacement of a protein diffusing in a membrane calculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Nowadays, the number of physical systems that have reported non-Gaussian diffusion emergence in systems whose diffusivity fluctuates is increasing. These systems may present non-Gaussian diffusion associated with a mean square displacement of trace-particles that may be normal or anomalous. To include anomalous diffusion, recent research has investigated superstatistics of scaled Brownian motion (SBM) to describe diffusion in biological matter. In this paper, we propose two diffusion models for SBM with random diffusivity governed by a stochastic equation. Based on a thorough analysis of simulations of stochastic modeling, we have shown the main remarkable features of each model. The first model generalizes the grey Brownian motion for SBM; this model is suitable to describe systems whose diffusion is ever non-Gaussian. The second model generalizes the minimal diffusing diffusivity model and is suitable to describe systems which present crossover from non-Gaussian to standard Gaussian processes. These results imply rich classes of the Non-Gaussian diffusion processes that may admit normal and anomalous diffusion as well as the crossover between them. We derive exact results for the dynamics of Rouse model in crowded environment modeled by stochastically varying diffusivity, the concept of ``diffusing diffusivity''. We specifically generalize the initial analytical formulation of this concept of diffusivity in single particle diffusion to many particle systems with localized interactions, particularly to chains of connected beads, the Rouse model. Independent Rouse modes are allowed to diffuse with stochastically varying time dependent diffusivities to model diffusion in the crowded rearranging environment, where zeroth mode represents the chain center of mass coordinate. We develop an analytical formalism to calculate the probability distribution of these individual mode displacements and subsequently average bead displacement distribution of the Rouse chain and its moments in terms of these modes. The resulting diffusion behavior of thus modified Rouse model is a function of mode resolved parameters which model local interactions and crowded environment collectively. Our analytically tractable implementation of the ``diffusing diffusivity'' concept to Rouse model is one of its kind that yields non-Gaussian diffusion with the scope of being anomalous and plausibly applied to dynamics in polymeric liquids.},

Several physical consequences are discussed which are relevant to dynamical processes in complex systems. Methods of solution are introduced and for some special cases exact solutions are calculated.

  abstract = {In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, genes are transcribed stochastically according to various temporal patterns that range from simple first-order kinetics to marked bursts, resulting in temporal and cell-to-cell variations of mRNA and protein levels. Here, we consider the effect of the transport of regulatory molecules on the noise in gene expression by taking into~account explicitly the dynamics of a finite number of transcription factors confined in the cell. We calculate analytically time-dependent correlation functions of mRNA levels for a wide range of transport mechanisms and find that in the limit of small-transcription-factor copy number, the results differ significantly from standard approaches, which ignore confinement. It is shown how such dynamical quantities, which can now be obtained experimentally, can be used to identify the underlying mechanisms of transcription. Of particular importance, it is demonstrated that the geometry of transcription-factor trajectories in the cellular environment plays a key role in transcription kinetics, and can intrinsically generate the observed various transcription patterns ranging from simple first-order kinetics to bursts.},

This process is driven by the presence of two distinct states of MT subunits, GTP- and GDP-bound tubulin dimers, that have different structural properties. Here, we use a combination of analysis and computer simulations to study the mechanical and kinetic regulation of dynamic instability in three-dimensional (3D) self-assembling MTs. Our model quantifies how the 3D structure and kinetics of the distinct states of tubulin dimers determine the mechanical stability of MTs. We further show that dynamic instability is influenced by the presence of quenched disorder in the state of the tubulin subunit as reflected in the fraction of non-hydrolysed tubulin. Our results connect the 3D geometry, kinetics and statistical mechanics of these tubular assemblies within a single framework, and may be applicable to other self-assembled systems where these same processes are at play.},

  abstract = {In [5] Karlin and McGregor analyzed a class of linear growth birth and death processes admitting a representation formula of the transition probability function in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials. Birth and death processes belong to the category of reversible stochastic processes (see [12] and [13]). In this case by invoking the spectral resolution of the identity for Hermitian operators one achieves the representation formula of Karlin and McGregor described in [3] and [4]. This theory is mostly restricted to the case of one-dimensional birth and death processes and diffusion processes. Some special higher dimensional birth and death processes motivated by certain applications in studies of population growth are reversible. For these processes there are representation formulae for the transition probability function that can be explicitly determined. In [9] and [10] Karlin and McGregor develop a discretized version of the classical technique of solving Laplace's equation in terms of spherical harmonics. This paper applies their method to determine the representation formula for the transition probability function of two two-dimensional (Sections 2 and 3) and the corresponding higher dimensional (Sections 4 and 5) linear growth birth and death processes. In each case the representation formula is expressed explicitly in terms of semi-direct products of classical orthogonal polynomials somewhat reminiscent of such products of spherical harmonics. In the Appendix the properties of the orthogonal polynomials are summarized and the method of derivation of the explicit form of the representation formula is outlined.},

Quantities of interest include probabilities that a walker will exit the lattice onto some particular set of boundary states, the expected duration of the walk, and the expected number of visits to one state given a start in another. These quantities are shown to satisfy two-dimensional recurrence relations that are very similar in structure. In each case, the recurrence relations may be represented by matrix equations of the form X = AX + XB + C, where A and B are tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices. The spectral properties of A and B are investigated and used to provide solutions to this matrix equation. The solutions to the matrix equations then lead to solutions for the recurrence relations in very general cases.}

Fractal landscape patterns affect the distributions and movements of animals, and therefore may be an important characteristic to include in designed landscapes. A computerized design system enables fractals to be created interactively and automatically overlayed on images or existing maps. The fractal designs are then used in simulations of foraging animals to determine how the new design affects themovements, energetics, and locations of species. The combination of computerized fractal designs and ecological simulation models may enhance both the ecological relevance and aesthetic value of the designed landscape. \copyright{} 1991.}

  abstract = {Animal movements have been related to optimal foraging strategies where self-similar trajectories are central. Most of the experimental studies done so far have focused mainly on fitting statistical models to data in order to test for movement patterns described by power-laws. Here we show by analyzing over half a million movement displacements that isolated termite workers actually exhibit a range of very interesting dynamical properties --including L\'evy flights-- in their exploratory behaviour. Going beyond the current trend of statistical model fitting alone, our study analyses anomalous diffusion and structure functions to estimate values of the scaling exponents describing displacement statistics. We evince the fractal nature of the movement patterns and show how the scaling exponents describing termite space exploration intriguingly comply with mathematical relations found in the physics of transport phenomena. By doing this, we rescue a rich variety of physical and biological phenomenology that can be potentially important and meaningful for the study of complex animal behavior and, in particular, for the study of how patterns of exploratory behaviour of individual social insects may impact not only their feeding demands but also nestmate encounter patterns and, hence, their dynamics at the social scale.},

  abstract = {The coffee-ring effect can be troublesome or beneficial in many surface coating and patterning technologies, prompting an extensive investigation into understanding its underlying mechanism. Although valuable insights are available on drying of polymer solutions on planar surfaces, such information is lacking for 3D-patterned substrates. Here, the experimental realization of the coffee-ring effect of a polymer solution on topographical surfaces is reported. Interestingly, the results indicate that, following the capillary flow, the polymer is divided between multiple contact lines on the 3D features and around the base. Therefore, for a proper spacing between the 3D patterns, it is demonstrated that the polymer deposit can be limited to the 3D structures, leaving the base unoccupied. This superposition property is then exploited to fabricate complex hierarchical materials with selective wrinkling on the 3D features, by simply drying a polymer solution on them and, subsequently crosslinking the polymers using plasma.},

How can a protein find its site on a long DNA molecule among 106--109 decoy sites? Here, we present our recent studies of the protein--DNA search problem. Seminal biophysical works suggested that the protein--DNA search is facilitated by 1D diffusion of the protein along DNA (sliding). We present a simple framework to calculate the mean search time and focus on several new aspects of the process such as the roles of DNA sequence and protein conformational flexibility. We demonstrate that coupling of DNA recognition with conformational transition within the protein--DNA complex is essential for fast search. To approach the complexity of the in vivo environment, we examine how the search can proceed at realistic DNA concentrations and binding constants. We propose a new mechanism for local distance-dependent search that is likely essential in bacteria. Simulations of the search on tightly packed DNA and crowded DNA demonstrate that our theoretical framework can be extended to correctly predicts search time in such complicated environments. We relate our findings to a broad range of experiments and summarize the results of our recent single-molecule studies of a eukaryotic protein (p53) sliding along DNA.},

Mated male and female gibbons approached and duetted in response to a simulated territorial intrusion by a neighboring group. Strange solitary females elicited similar approach and singing responses from mated pairs. In contrast, the simulated presence of a solitary male consistently evoked approaches by mated males only. Females and males did not contribute equally to pair movements or to answering songs; males led the majority of approaches, while females initiated all duets. I hypothesize that carrying small, vulnerable infants may inhibit females from leading approaches. These results are consistent with previous studies which suggest that female territoriality prevents male gibbons from becoming polygynous.},

In this review, we explore the biological objectives and physical mechanisms of intracellular transport. Our focus is on cytoplasmic and intra-organelle transport at the whole-cell scale. We outline several key biological functions that depend on physically transporting components across the cell, including the delivery of secreted proteins, support of cell growth and repair, propagation of intracellular signals, establishment of organelle contacts, and spatial organization of metabolic gradients. We then review the three primary physical modes of transport in eukaryotic cells: diffusive motion, motor-driven transport, and advection by cytoplasmic flow. For each mechanism, we identify the main factors that determine speed and directionality. We also highlight the efficiency of each transport mode in fulfilling various key objectives of transport, such as particle mixing, directed delivery, and rapid target search. Taken together, the interplay of diffusion, molecular motors, and flows supports the intracellular transport needs that underlie a broad variety of biological phenomena.},

  abstract = {Long-distance migration by terrestrial mammals is a phenomenon critical to the persistence of populations, but such migrations are declining globally because of over-harvest, habitat loss, and movement barriers. Increasingly, there is a need to improve existing routes, mitigate route segments affected by anthropogenic disturbance, and in some instances, determine whether alternative routes are available. Using a hypothesis-driven approach, we identified landscape features associated with the primary functional attributes, stopovers and movement corridors, of spring migratory routes for mule deer in two study areas using resource selection functions. Patterns of selection for landscape attributes of movement corridors and stopovers mostly were similar; however, landscape features associated with movement corridors aligned better with areas that facilitated movement, whereas selection of stopovers was consistent with sites offering early access to spring forage. For movement corridors, deer selected for dry sites, low elevation, and low anthropogenic disturbance. For stopovers, deer selected for dry sites, with consistently early green-up across years, south-southwesterly aspects, low elevation, and low anthropogenic disturbance. Stopovers and movement corridors of a migratory route presumably promote different functions, but for a terrestrial migrant, patterns of habitat selection indicate that the same general habitat attributes may facilitate both movement and foraging in spring. Our findings emphasize the roles of topographical wetness, vegetation phenology, and anthropogenic disturbance in shaping use of the landscape during migration for this large herbivore. Avoiding human disturbance and tracking ephemeral forage resources appear to be a consistent pattern during migration, which reinforces the notion that movement during migration has a nutritional underpinning and disturbance potentially alters the net benefits of migration.},

It looks at phenomenological fluctuation theories, stochastic processes such as Markoff and momentless processes, and stochastic geometric aspects of amorphous solids. Comprised of five chapters, this volume begins with an overview of fluctuations and the Ehrenfest dog-flea model. It then turns to a discussion of density fluctuations in dilute gases, the Langevin theory of Brownian motion, and classical diffusion and random walks. It also systematically introduces the reader to the statistical mechanical theory of the kinetics of phase transitions, the molecular theory of metastability, and multidimensional continuous time random walks, along with the effect of boundaries and defects onf stochastic processes. In addition, it describes the phenomenological theory of the kinetics of nucleation and its application to nucleation, spinodal decomposition, and condensation. Other chapters focus on a stochastic model for the kinetics of phase transitions, the physical ideas used in theories of metastability, and the importance of dynamics in the study of metastability. The book explains how to estimate the escape rate and describes the statistical mechanics of clusters before concluding with a discussion of slowly-varying ensembles. This book is a valuable resource for students, physicists, and researchers who want to gain more knowledge and learn about statistical mechanics in general and fluctuation phenomena in particular.},

Generally this time is proportional to the number of lattice points.The number of distinct points visited after n steps on a k-dimensional lattice (with k {$\geq$} 3) when n is large is a1n + a2n + a3 + a4n + \textbackslash ldots. The constants a1 - a4 have been obtained for walks on a simple cubic lattice when k = 3 and a1 and a2 are given for simple and face-centered cubic lattices. Formulas have also been obtained for the number of points visited r times in n steps as well as the average number of times a given point has been visited. The probability F(c) that a walker on a one-dimensional lattice returns to his starting point before being trapped on a lattice of trap concentration c is F(c) = 1 + [c/(1 - c)] log c.

  abstract = {The traditional models used to characterize animal home ranges have no mechanistic basis underlying their descriptions of space use, and as a result, the analysis of animal home ranges has primarily been a descriptive endeavor. In this paper, we char- acterize coyote (Canis latrans) home range patterns using partial differential equations for expected space use that are formally derived from underlying descriptions of individual movement behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first time that mechanistic models have been used to characterize animal home ranges. The results provide empirical support for a model formulation of movement response to scent marks, and suggest that having relo- cation data for individuals in adjacent groups is necessary to capture the spatial arrangement of home range boundaries.We then show how the model fits can be used to obtain predictions for individual movement and scent marking behavior and to predict changes in home range patterns. More generally, our findings illustrate how mechanistic models permit the de- velopment of a predictive theory for the relationship between movement behavior and animal spatial distribution.},

  abstract = {Patterns of space-use by individuals are fundamental to the ecology of animal populations influencing their social organization, mating systems, demography and the spatial distribution of prey and competitors. To date, the principal method used to analyse the underlying determinants of animal home range patterns has been resource selection analysis (RSA), a spatially implicit approach that examines the relative frequencies of animal relocations in relation to landscape attributes. In this analysis, we adopt an alternative approach, using a series of mechanistic home range models to analyse observed patterns of territorial space-use by coyote packs in the heterogeneous landscape of Yellowstone National Park. Unlike RSAs, mechanistic home range models are derived from underlying correlated random walk models of individual movement behaviour, and yield spatially explicit predictions for patterns of space-use by individuals. As we show here, mechanistic home range models can be used to determine the underlying determinants of animal home range patterns, incorporating both movement responses to underlying landscape heterogeneities and the effects of behavioural interactions between individuals. Our analysis indicates that the spatial arrangement of coyote territories in Yellowstone is determined by the spatial distribution of prey resources and an avoidance response to the presence of neighbouring packs. We then show how the fitted mechanistic home range model can be used to correctly predict observed shifts in the patterns of coyote space-use in response to perturbation.},

  abstract = {Spatial patterns of movement are fundamental to the ecology of animal populations, influencing their social organization, mating systems, demography, and the spatial distribution of prey and competitors. However, our ability to understand the causes and consequences of animal home range patterns has been limited by the descriptive nature of the statistical models used to analyze them. In Mechanistic Home Range Analysis, Paul Moorcroft and Mark Lewis develop a radically new framework for studying animal home range patterns based on the analysis of correlated random work models for individual movement behavior. They use this framework to develop a series of mechanistic home range models for carnivore populations. The authors' analysis illustrates how, in contrast to traditional statistical home range models that merely describe pattern, mechanistic home range models can be used to discover the underlying ecological determinants of home range patterns observed in populations, make accurate predictions about how spatial distributions of home ranges will change following environmental or demographic disturbance, and analyze the functional significance of the movement strategies of individuals that give rise to observed patterns of space use. By providing researchers and graduate students of ecology and wildlife biology with a more illuminating way to analyze animal movement, Mechanistic Home Range Analysis will be an indispensable reference for years to come.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews various enhanced conformational sampling methods and explicit/implicit solvent/membrane models, as well as their recent applications to the exploration of the structure and dynamics of membranes and membrane proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations have become an essential tool to investigate biological problems, and their success relies on proper molecular models together with efficient conformational sampling methods. The implicit representation of solvent/membrane environments is reasonable approximation to the explicit all-atom models, considering the balance between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Implicit models can be easily combined with replica-exchange molecular dynamics methods to explore a wider conformational space of a protein. Other molecular models and enhanced conformational sampling methods are also briefly discussed. As application examples, we introduce recent simulation studies of glycophorin A, phospholamban, amyloid precursor protein, and mixed lipid bilayers and discuss the accuracy and efficiency of each simulation model and method.

In fact, proteins once thought to be the purely eukaryotic inventions, including relatives of actin and tubulin control prokaryotic cell shape, DNA segregation, and cytokinesis. Similarly, compartmentalization, commonly noted as a distinguishing feature of eukaryotic cells, is also prevalent in the prokaryotic world in the form of protein-bounded and lipid-bounded organelles. In this article we highlight some of these prokaryotic organelles and discuss the current knowledge on their ultrastructure and the molecular mechanisms of their biogenesis and maintenance., Bacteria are far more compartmentalized than previously thought, containing membrane-bounded organelles such as magnetosomes, chromatophores, and pirellulosomes, whose formation and dynamics are precisely regulated.},

We present a metapopulation dynamic model on a temporal network; a subpopulation (patch) is represented by a node on a graph, and a link represents a migration path between patches. We consider the alternating graph as a temporal network. It alternates between star and complete graphs, where the nodes do not change but links vary temporally and periodically. Mobile individuals move by random walk through a link between nodes. Each individual is either susceptible (S) or infected (I). The reaction--diffusion equations are presented as ordinary differential equations with time-dependent coefficients. To evaluate the infection risk of each patch (node), we obtain the solutions of reaction--diffusion equations numerically. The temporal behavior of infected individuals depends highly on the frequency of the alternating graph. At low frequency, infected densities exhibit an oscillating behavior, while they keep a constant value at high frequencies. The crossover occurs from the oscillating state to the frozen state with increasing frequency. The SIS epidemic threshold is derived for the alternating graph. The epidemic threshold is lower than that on the star graph and higher than that on the complete graph.},

  abstract = {Tracking animal movements such as walking is an essential task for understanding how and why animals move in an environment and respond to external stimuli. Different methods that implemented image analysis and a data logger such as GPS have been used in laboratory experiments and in field studies, respectively. Recently, animal movement patterns without stimuli have attracted an increasing attention in search for common innate characteristics underlying all of their movements. However, it is difficult to track the movements in a vast and homogeneous environment without stimuli because of space constraints in laboratories or environmental heterogeneity in the field, hindering our understanding of inherent move- ment patterns. Here, we applied an omnidirectional treadmill mechanism, or a servosphere, as a tool for tracking two-dimensional movements of small animals that can provide both a homogenous environment and a virtual infinite space for walking. To validate the use of our tracking system for assessment of the free-walking behavior, we compared walking patterns of individual pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare) on the servosphere with that in two types of experimental flat arenas. Our results revealed that the walking patterns on the servosphere showed similar diffusive characteristics to those observed in the large arena simulating an open space, and we demonstrated that our mechanism provides more robust measure- ments of diffusive properties compared to a small arena with enclosure. Moreover, we showed that anomalous diffusion properties, including Le \textasciiacute vy walk, can be detected from the free-walking behavior on our tracking system. Thus, our novel tracking system is useful to measure inherent movement patterns, which will contribute to the studies of movement ecol- ogy, ethology, and behavioral sciences.}

This new field brings the physicist's style of inquiry to bear on the beautiful phenomena of life. The enormous range of phenomena encountered in living systems --- phenomena that often have no analog or precedent in the inanimate world --- means that the intellectual agenda of biological physics is exceptionally broad, even by the ambitious standards of physics. Physics of Life is the first decadal survey of this field, as part of a broader decadal survey of physics. This report communicates the importance of biological physics research; addresses what must be done to realize the promise of this new field; and provides guidance for informed decisions about funding, workforce, and research directions.},

  abstract = {Efficient random searches are essential to the survival of foragers searching for sparsely distributed targets. L\'evy walks have been found to optimize the search over a wide range of constraints. When targets are distributed within patches, generating a spatial memory over the detected targets can be beneficial towards optimizing the search efficiency. Because foragers have limited memory, storing each target location separately is unrealistic. Instead, we propose incrementally learning a spatial distribution in favour of memorizing target locations. We demonstrate that an ensemble of Gaussian mixture models is a suitable candidate for such a spatial distribution. Using this, a hybrid foraging strategy is proposed, which interchanges random searches with informed movement. Informed movement results in displacements towards target locations, and is more likely to occur if the learned spatial distribution is correct. We show that, depending on the strength of the memory effects, foragers optimize search efficiencies by continuous revisitation of non-destructive targets. However, this negatively affects both the target and patch diversity, indicating that memory does not necessarily optimize multi-objective searches. Hence, the benefits of memory depend on the specific goals of the forager. Furthermore, through analysis of the distribution over walking distances of the forager, we show that memory changes the underlying walk characteristics. Specifically, the forager resorts to Brownian motion instead of L\'evy walks, due to truncation of the long straight line displacements resulting from memory effects. This study provides a framework that opens up new avenues for investigating memory effects on foraging in sparse environments.},

  abstract = {The construction of coarse-grained descriptions of a system's kinetics is well established in biophysics. One prominent example is Markov state models in protein folding dynamics. In this paper, we develop a coarse-grained, discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal particle system inspired by the concepts of Markov state modelling. The specific self-aggregating system studied here involves field-responsive colloidal particles in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. Starting from particle-resolved (Brownian dynamics) simulations, we define the discrete states by categorizing each particle according to it's local structure. We then describe the kinetics between these states as a series of stochastic, memoryless jumps. In contrast to other works on colloidal self-assembly, our coarse-grained approach describes the simultaneous formation and evolution of multiple aggregates from single particles. Our discrete model also takes into account the changes in transition dynamics between the discrete states as the size of the largest cluster grows. We validate the coarse-grained model by comparing the predicted population fraction in each of the discrete states with those calculated directly from the particle-resolved simulations as a function of the largest cluster size. We then predict population fractions in presence of noise-averaging and in a situation where a model parameter is changed instantaneously after a certain time. Finally, we explore the validity of the detailed balance condition in the various stages of aggregation.},

  abstract = {The microtubule cytoskeleton is responsible for sustained, long-range intracellular transport of mRNAs, proteins, and organelles in neurons. Neuronal microtubules must be stable enough to ensure reliable transport, but they also undergo dynamic instability, as their plus and minus ends continuously switch between growth and shrinking. This process allows for continuous rebuilding of the cytoskeleton and for flexibility in injury settings. Motivated by \textbackslash textit\textbraceleft in vivo\textbraceright{} experimental data on microtubule behavior in \textbackslash textit\textbraceleft Drosophila\textbraceright{} neurons, we propose a mathematical model of dendritic microtubule dynamics, with a focus on understanding microtubule length, velocity, and state-duration distributions. We find that limitations on microtubule growth phases are needed for realistic dynamics, but the type of limiting mechanism leads to qualitatively different responses to plausible experimental perturbations. We therefore propose and investigate two minimally-complex length-limiting factors: limitation due to resource (tubulin) constraints and limitation due to catastrophe of large-length microtubules. We combine simulations of a detailed stochastic model with steady-state analysis of a mean-field ordinary differential equations model to map out qualitatively distinct parameter regimes. This provides a basis for predicting changes in microtubule dynamics, tubulin allocation, and the turnover rate of tubulin within microtubules in different experimental environments.},

Analytical expressions of the diffusion impedance in multi-layer solid cylinders (sorption/desorption experiments) and through multi-layer hollow cylinders (permeation experiments) have been obtained by integration of Fick's diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates. The resulting impedances are expressed as a function of the characteristics of individual active layers (layer thickness, diffusion coefficient and solubility of diffusing species in each layer). These impedance expressions can be used to characterize a large variety of experimental systems. In this work, model impedances have been used to fit experimental impedances of hydrogen permeation through Pd and Pd77Ag23/Pd mono- and bi-layer hollow cylinders, yielding the values of microscopic rate parameters (surface charge transfer resistances, diffusion coefficient). Analytical expressions of low frequency limits (stationary conditions of flow) have been derived. Practical conditions required for the separation of the contributions of the different layers are analyzed. Some limitations and perspectives offered by this work are discussed.},

In many cases a set of natural protein backbone structures, or ``scaffolds'', are searched to find regions where functional sites (an enzyme active site, ligand binding pocket, protein -- protein interaction region, etc.) can be placed, and the identities of the surrounding amino acids are optimized to satisfy functional constraints. Input native protein structures almost invariably have regions that score very poorly with the design force field, and any design based on these unmodified structures may result in mutations away from the native sequence solely as a result of the energetic strain. Because the input structure is already a stable protein, it is desirable to keep the total number of mutations to a minimum and to avoid mutations resulting from poorly-scoring input structures. Here we describe a protocol using cycles of minimization with combined backbone/sidechain restraints that is Pareto-optimal with respect to RMSD to the native structure and energetic strain reduction. The protocol should be broadly useful in the preparation of scaffold libraries for functional site design.},

The interaction between the intra- and extravascular as well as that between the intra- and extracellular spaces is examined. Susceptibility gradients due to the presence of deoxyhemoglobin can cause diffusion-induced signal losses which are significant in functional magnetic resonance experiments, particularly at higher main magnetic field strengths. This is also true of the fast response that manifests itself as an early negative signal change in functional magnetic resonance experiments. The fields surrounding paramagnetic vessels are described and the way in which diffusion in these fields contributes to functional signal changes is examined. Flow in the capillary bed can be a confounding factor in experiments which aim to examine the diffusion characteristics of extravascular water. It is potentially also a method for assessing capillary perfusion. The intravoxel incoherent motion experiment is described in terms of how significantly this effect can influence diffusion attenuation curves from water. The major models for describing water diffusion in tissue are presented, as are the main experimental results that have contributed to an understanding of the mechanisms of diffusion contrast. The widely accepted view that changes in the diffusion characteristics are caused by a shift of water to the intracellular space and a concomitant change in extracellular tortuosity is examined critically. More recent experiments that indicate that a reduction in the intracellular diffusion may occur simultaneously with the cell swelling are described and their compatibility with existing models discussed.

However, while there are many proposed approaches for reversibly breaching the skin barrier, our understanding of the molecular processes involved is still rudimentary. Molecular simulation offers an unprecedented molecular-level resolution with an ability to reproduce molecular and bulk level properties. We review the basis of the molecular simulation methodology and give applications of relevance to the skin lipid barrier, focusing on permeation of molecules and chemical approaches for breaching the lipid barrier by design. The bulk kinetic model based on Fick's Law describing absorption of a drug through skin has been reconciled with statistical mechanical quantities such as the local excess chemical potential and local diffusion coefficient within the membrane structure. Applications of molecular simulation reviewed include investigations of the structure and dynamics of simple models of skin lipids, calculation of the permeability of molecules in simple model membranes, and mechanisms of action of the penetration enhancers, DMSO, ethanol and oleic acid. The studies reviewed illustrate the power and potential of molecular simulation to yield important physical insights, inform and rationalize experimental studies, and to predict structural changes, and kinetic and thermodynamic quantities.},

  abstract = {Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments whose self-assembly occurs by abrupt switching between states of roughly constant growth and shrinkage, a process known as dynamic instability. Understanding the mechanism of dynamic instability offers potential for controlling microtubule-dependent cellular processes such as nerve growth and mitosis. The growth to shrinkage transitions (catastrophes) and the reverse transitions (rescues) that characterize microtubule dynamic instability have been assumed to be random events with first-order kinetics. By direct observation of individual microtubules in vitro and probabilistic analysis of their distribution of growth times, we found that while the slower growing and biologically inactive (minus) ends obeyed first-order catastrophe kinetics, the faster growing and biologically active (plus) ends ends did not. The non-first-order kinetics at plus ends imply that growing microtubule plus ends have an effective frequency of catastrophe that depends on how long the microtubules have been growing. This frequency is low initially but then rises asymptotically to a limiting value. Our results also suggest that an additional parameter, beyond the four parameters typically used to describe dynamic instability, is needed to account for the observed behavior and that changing this parameter can significantly affect the distribution of microtubule lengths at steady state.},

Under the experimental conditions (100 mM KCI and 1 mM MgCI2, or without KCI, 1 mM MgCI2 and 0.4 mM EGTA, 25{$^\circ$}C) ATP hydrolysis lagged behind polymerization by about 100 s independently of the concentration of polymerizing filament ends and of the actin monomer concentration. Three models of ATP hydrolysis were compared to experimental data: (i) Random ATP hydrolysis, ATP is assumed to be hydrolyzed at a rate that is independent of the type of nucleotide bound to adjacent filament subunits. (ii) Cooperative hydrolysis, the rate of ATP hydrolysis is thought to depend on the type of nucleotide bound to adjacent subunits. (iii) Sequential hydrolysis, ATP is assumed to be hydrolyzed only at the interface between ATP-subunits and ADP-subunits. The model of sequential ATP hydrolysis could be excluded. The results were in agreement with random or cooperative ATP hydrolysis. The differences of the rates of ATP hydrolysis by a random or cooperative mechanism are so small that based on the experimental results no distinction between these two mechanisms could be made. All available evidence points towards a mechanism of ATP hydrolysis in which several or perhaps many interfaces between ATP- and ADP-subunits are formed within a filament.},

The theory subsumes the whole of optimal foraging theory as one special case of foraging behaviour defined by the physiological requirements of animals. The theory explains foraging in terms of both the acquisition of food and the utilization of food in the maintenance of life.},

We study the efficiency of a minimalist search model based on Levy flights in the absence and presence of an external drift (underwater current, atmospheric wind, a preference of the walker owing to prior experience, or a general bias in an abstract search space) based on two different optimization criteria with respect to minimal search time and search reliability (cumulative arrival probability). Although Levy flights turn out to be efficient search processes when the target is far from the starting point, or when relative to the starting point the target is upstream, we show that for close targets and for downstream target positioning regular Brownian motion turns out to be the advantageous search strategy. Contrary to claims that Levy flights with a critical exponent alpha = 1 are optimal for the search of sparse targets in different settings, based on our optimization parameters the optimal alpha may range in the entire interval (1, 2) and especially include Brownian motion as the overall most efficient search strategy.},

Existing research mainly compares the effectiveness of various random walk methods through experimental verification, which has relatively large limitations. In order to make the application of the random walk methods more convenient, this paper quantitatively analyzes the searching efficiency (SE) of random walk methods. Firstly, the formula of the mean square displacement (MSD) of the robot position is given, and it is shown that the mean and the variance of the random step length are the factors that affect the SE. In addition, in order to produce the suitable step length, a truncated random walk method is constructed to make the generated step lengths follow a given distribution and the step lengths are within a specified range, thereby improving the SE. Thirdly, the correlations between the step length threshold (SLT), the area of the region, and the number of robots are provided based on MSD and truncated random walk method. When the area of region and the number of robots are fixed, there exists a SLT. When the expectation of the step length is greater than SLT, the swarm robots can achieve the highest SE. The area exploration task of swarm robots are carried out in simulation experiments and the coverage ratio is used to evaluate the SE of each random walk method. The experimental results show that when the area and the number of robots are given, there exist an optimal step length, which can enable the robots to achieve the optimal search.},

Single-atom representations using the backbone atoms C{$\alpha$}, C, N, and C{$\beta$}are considered. Combinations of some of these atoms are also tested. The force constants between the representative atoms are extracted from the Hessian matrix of the energy function and served as the force constants between the corresponding residues. The residue mean-square-fluctuations and their correlations with the experimental B-factors are calculated for a large set of proteins. The results are compared with all-atom normal mode analysis and the residue-level Gaussian Network Model. The coarse-grained methods perform more efficiently than all-atom normal mode analysis, while their B-factor correlations are also higher. Their B-factor correlations are comparable with those estimated by the Gaussian Network Model and in many cases better. The extracted force constants are surveyed for different pairs of residues with different numbers of separation residues in sequence. The statistical averages are used to build a refined Gaussian Network Model, which is able to predict residue-level structural fluctuations significantly better than the conventional Gaussian Network Model in many test cases.},

Such surveys are conducted with side-looking sonar sensors whose performance is dependent on environmental, target, sensor, and AUV platform parameters. It is difficult to obtain precise knowledge of all of these parameters to be able to design optimal mission plans offline. This research represents the first known sensor driven online approach to seabed coverage for MCM. A method is presented where paths are planned using a multiobjective optimization. Information theory is combined with a new concept coined branch entropy based on a hexagonal cell decomposition. The result is a planning algorithm that not only produces shorter paths than conventional means, but is also capable of accounting for environmental factors detected in situ. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and in water trials conducted on the IVER2 AUV show the effectiveness of the proposed method. \copyright{} 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Abstract--- Mobile electronic excited states, excitons, undergo random walks through the antenna chlorophyll arrays of photosynthetic organisms. The time interval from exciton creation, by photon absorption, until its first arrival at a reaction center (RC) is called the ``first passage time'' (FPT) of the random walk. A theory of exciton migration and trapping presented here predicts that the exciton lifetime, as measured from chlorophyll fluorescence decay in chromatophores or P700 complexes, is a linear function of the fractional number of quanta absorbed directly by the antenna, not by the RC. The slope of this line is the FPT, and its intercept is the exciton's lifetime as limited only by photoconversion at the RC. This photoconversion-limited lifetime is simply related to the in situ photoconversion rate constant via two parameters, each of which is experimentally accessible. It is also possible to obtain values of individual FoUrster rate constants, at least approximately, from measurements of exciton lifetime as functions of temperature and excitation wavelength. This new theory, based on lattice random walk models, receives some support from fluorescence measurements done on Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides R26 chromatophores. In its present form the theory is only applicable to one-antenna-component systems, like Rp. sphaeroides R26 or Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores or P700 complexes, but should be readily extendible to multi-antenna-component systems including whole chloroplasts.},

The estimation problem is formulated as a hidden Markov model (HMM) on a spatial grid in continuous time, which allows straightforward implementation of barriers to movement. Using the grid to explicitly resolve space, location estimation can be supplemented by or based entirely on environmental data (e.g. temperature, daylight). The HMM method can therefore analyze any type of electronic tag data. The HMM computes the joint posterior probability distribution of location and behavior at each point in time. With this, the behavioral state of the animal can be associated to regions in space, thus revealing migration corridors and residence areas. We demonstrate the inferential potential of the method by analyzing satellite-linked archival tag data from a southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii where longitudinal coordinates inferred from daylight are supplemented by latitudinal information in recorded sea surface temperatures.},

As an illustration, we apply our framework to the adaptation of gene-regulatory networks under a dynamic genotype-phenotype map: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slowly evolving distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a network structure. We establish that under this map, genotypes corresponding to reciprocal networks of coherent feedback loops are selected within an intermediate range of environmental noise, leading to phenotypic robustness.},

Immanuel Kant  is considered to be one of the central Enlightenment thinkers of all time. His philosophy is called Kantianism.  So here are 7 time management tips from Immanuel Kant -  01. Organize yourself 02. Follow through 03. Follow universal principles in your daily activities 04. Schedule time for developing your skills 05. Make time for the small things 06. Make time for your other duties  07. Make time for moral self-development Hope you enjoyed this video and find these insights on time management from Immanuel Kant helpful.  Immanuel Kant lived in the 18th century and is considered to be one of the greatest German philosophers and one of the central Enlightenment thinkers of all time. His philosophical revolution was to place the human at the center of the philosophical study of knowledge, morality, and beauty.  He deeply believed that reason is the root of morality. His thoughts on the relationship between reason and human experience led to the notion of ``procedural humanism'' or ``Kantian humanism''.  The work of Immanuel Kant is still relevant today as the humanistic values of Western culture are deeply influenced by the Kantian moral philosophy. His philosophy is called Kantianism The fundamental idea of Kant's ``critical philosophy'' -- especially in his three Critiques: the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790) -- is human autonomy. He argues that human understanding is the source of the general laws of nature that structure all our experience; and that human reason gives itself the moral law, which is our basis for belief in God, freedom, and immortality.

We further suggest that it is not possible to test whether behaviour has been selected to fulfil specific functions, that such tests have not been carried out, and that no optimization model of foraging behaviour has been supported.

Therefore understanding what factors effect microtubule growth is fundamental to our understanding of the control of microtubule based processes. An important factor that determines the status of a microtubule, whether it is growing or shrinking, is the length of the GTP tubulin microtubule cap. Here, we derive a Monte Carlo model of the assembly and disassembly of microtubules. We use thermodynamic laws to reduce the number of parameters of our model and, in particular, we take into account the contribution of water to the entropy of the system. We fit all parameters of the model from published experimental data using the GTP tubulin dimer attachment rate and the lateral and longitudinal binding energies of GTP and GDP tubulin dimers at both ends. Also we calculate and incorporate the GTP hydrolysis rate. We have applied our model and can mimic published experimental data, which formerly suggested a single layer GTP tubulin dimer microtubule cap, to show that these data demonstrate that the GTP cap can fluctuate and can be several microns long.},

  abstract = {Biofilms inhabit a range of environments, such as dental plaques or soil micropores, often characterized by intricate, non-even surfaces. However, the impact of surface irregularities on the population dynamics of biofilms remains elusive as most biofilm experiments are conducted on flat surfaces. Here, we show that the shape of the surface on which a biofilm grows influences genetic drift and selection within the biofilm. We culture E. coli biofilms in micro-wells with an undulating bottom surface and observe the emergence of clonal sectors whose size corresponds to that of the undulations, despite no physical barrier separating different areas of the biofilm. The sectors are remarkably stable over time and do not invade each other; we attribute this stability to the characteristics of the velocity field within the growing biofilm, which hinders mixing and clonal expansion. A microscopically-detailed computer model fully reproduces these findings and highlights the role of mechanical (physical) interactions such as adhesion and friction in microbial evolution. The model also predicts clonal expansion to be severely limited even for clones with a significant growth advantage -- a finding which we subsequently confirm experimentally using a mixture of antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant mutants in the presence of sub-lethal concentrations of the antibiotic rifampicin. The strong suppression of selection contrasts sharply with the behavior seen in bacterial colonies on agar commonly used to study range expansion and evolution in biofilms. Our results show that biofilm population dynamics can be controlled by patterning the surface, and demonstrate how a better understanding of the physics of bacterial growth can pave the way for new strategies in steering microbial evolution.},

Depending on the nature of the intrinsic bias, the system's behaviour displays two regimes, characterised by (i) the particles moving towards each other and (ii) away from each other, both qualitatively different from the case of no bias.

To explain and unify these two aspects of animal space use, we use recently developed mechanistic models of collective animal movement. We apply our approach to a natural experiment on an urban red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population that underwent a rapid decline in population density due to a sarcoptic mange epizooty. By extracting details of movement and interaction strategies from location data, we show how foxes alter their behavior, taking advantage of sudden population-level changes by acquiring areas vacated due to neighbor mortality, while ensuring territory boundaries remain contiguous. The rate of territory border movement increased eightfold as the population declined and the foxes' response time to neighboring scent reduced by a third. By demonstrating how observed, fluctuating territorial patterns emerge from movements and interactions of individual animals, our results give the first data-validated, mechanistic explanation of the elastic disc hypothesis, proposed nearly 80 years ago.},

At the population level, animals often segregate into distinct territorial areas. Consequently, it should be possible to derive territorial patterns from the underlying behavioural processes of animal movements and interactions. Such derivations are an important element in the development of an ecological theory that can predict the effects of changing conditions on territorial populations. Here, we review the approaches developed over the past 20 years or so, which go under the umbrella of 'mechanistic territorial models'. We detail the two main strands to this research: partial differential equations and individual-based approaches, showing what each has offered to our understanding of territoriality and how they can be unified. We explain how they are related to other approaches to studying territories and home ranges, and point towards possible future directions.},

These proteins structurally transduce biochemical information in a manner analogous to how transistors control information flow in computing devices. Engineering challenges ranging from biological computing devices to molecular motors require such two-state switches, but designing these is an unsolved problem as it requires sculpting an energy landscape with two low-energy but structurally distinct conformations that can be modulated by external inputs. Here we describe a general design approach for creating ``hinge'' proteins that populate one distinct state in the absence of ligand and a second designed state in the presence of ligand. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that despite the significant structural differences, the two states are designed with atomic level accuracy. The kinetics and thermodynamics of effector binding can be finely tuned by modulating the free energy differences between the two states; when this difference becomes sufficiently small, we obtain bistable proteins that populate both states in the absence of effector, but collapse to a single state upon effector addition. Like the transistor, these switches now enable the design of a wide array of molecular information processing systems.},

Representative numerical results for the probability of return to the starting point and the probability of absorption are presented for the one-dimensional case.

This work addresses a critical gap in this context by proposing two microcanonical random null models for directed hypergraphs: the directed hypergraph degree model (dhdm) and the directed hypergraph JOINT model (dhjm). These models preserve essential structural properties of directed hypergraphs such as node in- and out-degree sequences and hyperedge head- and tail-size sequences, or their joint tensor. We also describe two efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, nudhy-degs and nudhy-joint, to sample random hypergraphs from these ensembles. To showcase the interdisciplinary applicability of the proposed null models, we present three distinct use cases in sociology, epidemiology, and economics. First, we reveal the oscillatory behavior of increased homophily in opposition parties in the U.S. Congress over a 40-year span, emphasizing the role of higher-order structures in quantifying political group homophily. Second, we investigate a nonlinear contagion in contact hypernetworks, demonstrating that disparities between simulations and theoretical predictions can be explained by considering higher-order joint degree distributions. Last, we examine the economic complexity of countries in the global trade network, showing that local network properties preserved by nudhy explain the main structural economic complexity indexes. This work advances the development of null models for directed hypergraphs, addressing the intricate challenges posed by their complex entity relations, and providing a versatile suite of tools for researchers across various domains.},

We demonstrate with numerical examples that chaos in the sense of positivity of Lyapunov exponents is neither necessary nor sufficient to guarantee normal transport in 1D lattices. Quite surprisingly, we find that in the absence of momentum conservation, even ergodicity of an isolated system is not necessary for the normal transport.

  abstract = {It is known that the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) used in digital signal processing can be characterized in the framework of the representation theory of algebras, namely, as the decomposition matrix for the regular module C[Zn] = C[x]/(xn - 1). This characterization provides deep insight into the DFT and can be used to derive and understand the structure of its fast algorithms. In this paper we present an algebraic characterization of the important class of discrete cosine and sine transforms as decomposition matrices of certain regular modules associated with four series of Chebyshev polynomials. Then we derive most of their known algorithms by pure algebraic means. We identify the mathematical principle behind each algorithm and give insight into its structure. Our results show that the connection between algebra and digital signal processing is stronger than previously understood.},

We perform numerical simulations in \$1\$-dimension to obtain \$\textbackslash sigma\_c \textbackslash sim 1.14\$. The three-dimensional version of this model is related to the phenomenon of chemotaxis. Diffusiophoretic theory supplemented with coarse-grained simulations establish the connection with the specific value of \$\textbackslash sigma = 2\$ as a consequence of in-built solvent diffusion. A variant of the one-dimensional power-law model is found to be applicable in the context of a stock investor devising a strategy for extricating their portfolio out of loss.},

Any general stochastic diffusion process without detailed balance, in terms of its Fokker-Planck equation, can be decomposed into a reversible diffusion process with detailed balance and a canonical conservative dynamics. This decomposition can be rigorously established in a function space with inner product defined as {$\langle\phi$}, {$\psi\rangle$} = {$\int\rho-$}1(x){$\phi$}(x){$\psi$}(x)dx. Furthermore, a law for balancing F[u] can be obtained: The non-positive dF[u(x, t)]/dt = Ein(t) - ep(t) where the ``source'' Ein(t) ⩾ 0 and the ``sink'' ep(t) ⩾ 0 are known as house-keeping heat and entropy production, respectively. A reversible diffusion has Ein(t) = 0. For a linear (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) diffusion process, our decomposition is equivalent to the previous approaches developed by Graham and Ao, as well as the theory of large deviations. In terms of two different formulations of time reversal for a same stochastic process, the meanings of dissipative and conservative stationary dynamics are discussed.},

A new mathematical model is developed here for predicting the spatial distribution of infection risk of airborne transmitted diseases by integrating the Wells--Riley equation into computational fluid dynamics. We applied our new integrated model to analyze a large nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS epidemics, which was studied in the literature with regard to the association between airflow and SARS infection. The predicted numbers of infected cases of medical students in the same cubicle, the adjacent cubicle and the distant cubicle were 6.39, 0.78 and 0.2 respectively while the observed numbers of infected medical students in the three cubicles were 7, 0 and 0 respectively during the morning of March 6th, which was the highest attack period. The predicted numbers of infected cases of inpatients during the morning of March 6th in the same cubicle, the adjacent cubic and the distance cubicle were 7.8, 5.1, and 4.8 respectively which also agree well with the observed distribution of the infected inpatients during the entire infection period. The new developed model provides a new modelling tool for investigating the airborne transmission of diseases in enclosed spaces. The model is applicable when the susceptible stays mostly at the same location in an enclosed space during the infectious period, such as inpatients in a hospital ward, passengers in an airplane etc.},

One issue that obscures this discussion is whether or not theoretical predictions on strictly 2D systems describe those of quasi-2D experimental systems, where out-of-plane fluctuations may alter the melting mechanism. Using event-driven Molecular Dynamics simulations, we find that the peculiar two-stage melting scenario of a continuous solid-hexatic and a first-order hexatic-liquid transition as observed for a truly 2D system of hard disks [Bernard and Krauth, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 155704 (2011)] persists for a quasi-2D system of hard spheres with out-of-plane particle motions as high as half the particle diameter. By calculating the renormalized Young's modulus, we show that the solid-hexatic transition is of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type, and occurs via dissociation of bound dislocation pairs. In addition, we find a first-order hexatic-liquid transition that seems to be driven by a spontaneous proliferation of grain boundaries.},

Rapid, accurate, and easily configurable molecular diagnostic tests are imperative to prevent global spread of new diseases. CRISPR-based diagnostic approaches are proving to be useful as field-deployable solutions. In one basic form of this assay, the CRISPR--Cas12 enzyme complexes with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA). This complex becomes activated only when it specifically binds to target DNA and cleaves it. The activated complex thereafter nonspecifically cleaves single-stranded DNA reporter probes labeled with a fluorophore-quencher pair. We discovered that electric field gradients can be used to control and accelerate this CRISPR assay by cofocusing Cas12--gRNA, reporters, and target within a microfluidic chip. We achieve an appropriate electric field gradient using a selective ionic focusing technique known as isotachophoresis (ITP) implemented on a microfluidic chip. Unlike previous CRISPR diagnostic assays, we also use ITP for automated purification of target RNA from raw nasopharyngeal swab samples. We here combine this ITP purification with loop-mediated isothermal amplification and the ITP-enhanced CRISPR assay to achieve detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA (from raw sample to result) in about 35 min for both contrived and clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. This electric field control enables an alternate modality for a suite of microfluidic CRISPR-based diagnostic assays.},

This article will initially discuss each transdermal enhancement method used in the development of first-generation transdermal products. These methods include drug/vehicle interactions, vesicles and particles, stratum corneum modification, energy-driven methods and stratum corneum bypassing techniques. Through suitable design and implementation of active stratum corneum bypassing methods, notably microneedle technology, transdermal delivery systems have been shown to deliver both low and high molecular weight drugs. Microneedle technology platforms have proven themselves to be more versatile than other transdermal systems with opportunities for intradermal delivery of drugs/ biotherapeutics and therapeutic drug monitoring. These have shown that microneedles have been a prospective strategy for improving transdermal delivery systems.},

We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats.

  abstract = {The flux of neurotransmitter receptors in and out of synapses depends on receptor interaction with scaffolding molecules. However, the crowd of transmembrane proteins and the rich cytoskeletal environment may constitute obstacles to the diffusion of receptors within the synapse. To address this question, we studied the membrane diffusion of the {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) subunits clustered ({$\gamma$}2) or not ({$\alpha$}5) at inhibitory synapses in rat hippocampal dissociated neurons. Relative to the extrasynaptic region, {$\gamma$}2 and {$\alpha$}5 showed reduced diffusion and increased confinement at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses but they dwelled for a short time at excitatory synapses. In contrast, {$\gamma$}2 was {$\sim$}3-fold more confined and dwelled {$\sim$}3-fold longer in inhibitory synapses than {$\alpha$}5, indicating faster synaptic escape of {$\alpha$}5. Furthermore, using a gephyrin dominant-negative approach, we showed that the increased residency time of {$\gamma$}2 at inhibitory synapses was due to receptor-scaffold interactions. As shown for GABAAR, the excitatory glutamate receptor 2 subunit (GluA2) of the {$\alpha$}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) had lower mobility in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses but a higher residency time at excitatory synapses. Therefore barriers impose significant diffusion constraints onto receptors at synapses where they accumulate or not. Our data further reveal that the confinement and the dwell time but not the diffusion coefficient report on the synapse specific sorting, trapping and accumulation of receptors.},

  abstract = {Composite correlated random walks have been posited as a strong alternative to L\'evy walks as models of multi-scale forager movement patterns. Here it is shown that if plastic then intrinsic composite correlated random walks will, under selection pressures, evolve to resemble optimal L\'evy walks when foraging is non-destructive. The fittest composite correlated random walkers are found to be those that come closest to being optimal L\'evy walkers. This may explain why such a diverse range of foragers have movement patterns that can be approximated by optimal L\'evy walks and shows that the 'L\'evy-flight foraging' hypothesis has a broad hinterland. The new findings are consistent with recent observations of mussels Mytilus edulis and the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti which suggest that animals approximate a L\'evy walk by adopting an intrinsic composite movement strategy with different modes. \copyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Development plays a critical role in structuring the joint offspring--parent phenotype distribution. It thus must be part of any truly general evolutionary theory. Historically, the offspring--parent distribution has often been treated in such a way as to bury the contribution of development, by distilling from it a single term, either heritability or additive genetic variance, and then working only with this term. I discuss two reasons why this approach is no longer satisfactory. First, the regression of expected offspring phenotype on parent phenotype can easily be nonlinear, and this nonlinearity can have a pronounced impact on the response to selection. Second, even when the offspring--parent regression is linear, it is nearly always a function of the environment, and the precise way that heritability covaries with the environment can have a substantial effect on adaptive evolution. Understanding these complexities of the offspring--parent distribution will require understanding of the developmental processes underlying the traits of interest. I briefly discuss how we can incorporate such complexity into formal evolutionary theory, and why it is likely to be important even for traits that are not traditionally the focus of evo--devo research. Finally, I briefly discuss a topic that is widely seen as being squarely in the domain of evo--devo: novelty. I argue that the same conceptual and mathematical framework that allows us to incorporate developmental complexity into simple models of trait evolution also yields insight into the evolution of novel traits.

  abstract = {A simple model system for oscillatory reactions, which includes reverse reactions, is analyzed with respect to the control features that it develops far from equilibrium, and with respect to dissipation (entropy production), that is the efficiency of the reaction, from the point of view of chemical energy conversion. The study leads to the following observations which are likely to be independent of the model. The introduction of reverse reactions greatly enriches the types of behavior that the system displays, including hysteresis and excitability. The occurrence of oscillations is linked to a high differential susceptibility of the steady-state flux with respect to changes in overall affinity. Such control features are costly in terms of increased dissipation, but there is a possibility for limit cycle oscillations to reduce the average dissipation with respect to the steady-state values. When the system is subjected to imposed oscillations of moderate amplitude on the input side, we find a characteristic pattern in the dissipation spectrum: The dissipation in the autocatalytic reaction step of the mechanism is substantially lowered in the entrainment bands except near the boundaries between periodic and quasi-periodic behavior. However, the dissipation of the overall reaction is hardly affected because the output reaction cancels any advantages gained. If both the input and output sides are made to oscillate, then appreciable changes in the dissipation of the total reaction can be obtained. The sign of the change depends on the relative phase between input and output oscillations; small phase changes may lead to large changes in dissipation, which may be used as an additional control feature. A phase change can also alter the mode of operation from periodic to quasiperiodic with attendant changes in dissipation.},

Calcium imaging provides access to in vivo recordings of whole-brain activity at single-neuron resolution and, therefore, allows the study of how large-scale brain dynamics emerge from local activity. In this study, we use a statistical mechanics approach---the pairwise maximum entropy model---to infer microscopic network features from collective patterns of activity in the larval zebrafish brain and relate these features to the emergence of observed whole-brain dynamics. Our findings indicate that the pairwise interactions between neural populations and their intrinsic activity states are sufficient to explain observed whole-brain dynamics. In fact, the pairwise relationships between neuronal populations estimated with the maximum entropy model strongly correspond to observed structural connectivity patterns. Model simulations also demonstrated how tuning pairwise neuronal interactions drives transitions between observed physiological regimes and pathologically hyperexcitable whole-brain regimes. Finally, we use virtual resection to identify the brain structures that are important for maintaining the brain in a physiological dynamic regime. Together, our results indicate that whole-brain activity emerges from a complex dynamical system that transitions between basins of attraction whose strength and topology depend on the connectivity between brain areas.},

They are formed by successive steps of random finite lengths and directions travelled at a fixed speed. The isotropic and symmetric 1D persistent random walk is governed by the telegrapher's equation, also called the hyperbolic heat conduction equation. These equations have been designed to resolve the paradox of the infinite speed in the heat and diffusion equations. The finiteness of both the speed and the correlation length leads to several classes of random walks: Persistent random walk in one dimension can display anomalies that cannot arise for Brownian motion such as anisotropy and asymmetries. In this work we focus on the case where the mean free path is anisotropic, the only anomaly leading to a physics that is different from the telegrapher's case. We derive exact expression of its Green's function, for its scattering statistics and distribution of first-passage time at the origin. The phenomenology of the latter shows a transition for quantities like the escape probability and the residence time.},

The policy implication of the TCM is that policy measures which effectively lead to a reduction of the total consumption, will most likely also reduce the extent of harmful consumption and related harms. Problem gambling constitutes a public health issue and more insight into problem gambling at the societal level and a better understanding of how public policies may impact on the harm level, are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to review the literature pertaining to empirical validity of the TCM with regard to gambling behaviour and problem gambling and, on the basis of the literature review, to discuss the policy implications of the TCM.Methods:The study is based on a literature mapping through systematic searches in literature databases, and forward and backward reference searches.Results:The literature searches identified a total of 12 empirical studies that examined the total consumption model or provided relevant data. All but one of these studies found empirical support for the TCM; that is, a positive association between population gambling mean and prevalence of excessive or problem gambling. Such associations were found both with cross-sectional data and with longitudinal data.Conclusion:There is a small but fairly consistent literature lending empirical support to the total consumption model. An important policy implication is that interventions which are successful in reducing overall gambling are likely also to reduce problem gambling incidence.},

  abstract = {To know how particles move in small cavities, micro-channels and in general in crowded media currently constitutes a challenge for the understanding of basic mechanisms governing the behaviour of small-scale soft-matter and biological systems. The presence of obstacles, constrictions and irregularities in the shape of these structures significantly alters their trajectories thus modifying their transport properties. An analysis of these properties based on the use of diffusion and stochastic equations faces the problem of solving these equations for very complex boundaries which may constitute a formidable task. Recent studies on transport through confined media have shown that this problem can be considerably simplified if one assimilates spatial restrictions to the entropic barriers which particles must surmount in order to proceed. A wide variety of situations can be studied in this way, including many that were thought to be beyond the reach of classical transport theories, such as diffusion through deformable channels, motion of ions at very small length scales and behaviour of confined active matter.},

To appreciate why, we first state the problem, outline historical approaches, and survey the present state of the physics of self-organization. This frames the particular challenges arising from mathematical intractability and the resulting need for computational approaches, as well as those arising from a chronic failure to define structure. Then, an overview of two modern mathematical formulations of organization -- intrinsic computation and evolution operators -- lays out a way to overcome these challenges. Together, the vantage point they afford shows how to account for the emergence of structured states via a statistical mechanics of systems arbitrarily far from equilibrium. The result is a constructive path forward to principles of organization that builds on mathematical identification of structure.},

We propose both an exact solution relying on a matrix inversion, and an approximate explicit solution. The approximate solution is shown to be exact for an exit of vanishing size and to be accurate even for large exits. For angular sectors, we also derive exact explicit formulas for the moments of the exit time. For annuli and rectangles, the approximate expression of the mean exit time is shown to be very accurate even for large exits. The analysis is also extended to biased diffusion. Since the Helmholtz equation with mixed boundary conditions is encountered in microfluidics, heat propagation, quantum billiards, and acoutics, the developed method can find numerous applications beyond exit processes.},

The designs are stable, folded, and soluble in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing, and crystal structures are close to the computational models. We construct linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to six different components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub and demonstrate that such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange. Our approach provides a general route to designing asymmetric reconfigurable protein systems.},

However, an AlphaFold ensemble of models usually represents a single conformational state with minimal structural heterogeneity. Consequently, several pipelines have been proposed to either expand the structural breadth of an ensemble or bias the prediction toward a desired conformational state.

  abstract = {Animal territoriality is a widespread phenomena in many vertebrate species. In mammals it is often associated with territorial marking with which individuals make their presence conspicuous to others by leaving trace of their passage, often in the form of deposited scent. A simple interaction mechanism consisting of retreating upon the encounter of a foreign scent is sufficient to observe the emergence of territorial patterns at the population level. With the introduction of the so-called territorial random walk model this local avoidance mechanism coupled with a simple diffusive movement of the individuals has been shown to generate long-lasting patterns of segregation at much larger spatial scales. To shed further light on the micro-to-macro connection of this collective movement model we study how the movement statistics of the individuals affect the formation of the segregated scented territories. We represent individual animals as correlated random walkers and we analyse the spatial ordering of the population as a function of the length of time a scent mark remains active after deposition and as a function of the degree of correlation of the movement steps. For low and intermediate correlation strength we find that territories undergo a liquid-hexatic-solid transition as active scent time is increased. Increased spatial order also appears by increasing the correlation strength but only if well away from the ballistic limit. We ascribe this non-monotonic dependence to the coverage efficiency of the individual walkers mainly controlled by the correlation and the mobility of the territories mainly controlled by the active scent time.},

  abstract = {Inert interactions between randomly moving entities and spatial disorder play a crucial role in quantifying the diffusive properties of a system, with examples ranging from molecules advancing along dendritic spines to antipredator displacements of animals due to sparse vegetation. Despite the ubiquity of such phenomena, a general framework to model the movement explicitly in the presence of spatial heterogeneities is missing. Here, we tackle this challenge and develop an analytic theory to model inert particle-environment interactions in domains of arbitrary shape and dimensions. We use a discrete space formulation, which allows us to model the interactions between an agent and the environment as perturbed dynamics between lattice sites. Interactions from spatial disorder, such as impenetrable and permeable obstacles or regions of increased or decreased diffusivity, as well as many others, can be modelled using our framework. We provide exact expressions for the generating function of the occupation probability of the diffusing particle and related transport quantities such as first-passage, return, and exit probabilities and their respective means. We uncover a surprising property, the disorder indifference phenomenon of the mean first-passage time in the presence of a permeable barrier in quasi-1D systems. We demonstrate the widespread applicability of our formalism by considering three examples that span across scales and disciplines. (1) We explore an enhancement strategy of transdermal drug delivery. (2) We represent the movement decisions of an animal undergoing thigomotaxis, the tendency to remain at the peripheries of its enclosure, using a spatially disordered environment.

Many real-world complex systems can be modeled as adaptive networks, including social networks, transportation networks, neural networks and biological networks.

We also report our recent work on several applications of computational adaptive network modeling and analysis to real-world problems, including temporal development of search and rescue operational networks, automated rule discovery from empirical network evolution data, and cultural integration in corporate merger.},

Within the microtubule shaft, dimers adopt a densely packed and highly ordered crystal-like lattice structure, which is generally not considered to be dynamic. Here, we report that thermal forces are sufficient to remodel the microtubule shaft, despite its apparent stability. Our combined experimental data and numerical simulations on lattice dynamics and structure suggest that dimers can spontaneously leave and be incorporated into the lattice at structural defects. We propose a model mechanism, where the lattice dynamics is initiated via a passive breathing mechanism at dislocations, which are frequent in rapidly growing microtubules. These results show that we may need to extend the concept of dissipative dynamics, previously established for microtubule extremities, to the entire shaft, instead of considering it as a passive material.},

To test this, we followed the frequency of the transinfected Wolbachia strain wMel through Ae. aegypti in Cairns, Australia, following releases at 3 nonisolated locations within the city in early 2013. Spatial spread was analysed graphically using interpolation and by fitting a statistical model describing the position and width of the wave. For the larger 2 of the 3 releases (covering 0.97 km2 and 0.52 km2), we observed slow but steady spatial spread, at about 100--200 m per year, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. In contrast, the smallest release (0.11 km2) produced erratic temporal and spatial dynamics, with little evidence of spread after 2 years. This is consistent with the prediction concerning fitness-decreasing Wolbachia transinfections that a minimum release area is needed to achieve stable local establishment and spread in continuous habitats. Our graphical and likelihood analyses produced broadly consistent estimates of wave speed and wave width. Spread at all sites was spatially heterogeneous, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity will affect large-scale Wolbachia transformations of urban mosquito populations. The persistence and spread of Wolbachia in release areas meeting minimum area requirements indicates the promise of successful large-scale population transformation.},

The study of dynamic interactions between proteins and their cognate ligands is therefore fundamental to the understanding of biological systems. During the last two decades MS, and its associated techniques, has become accepted as a method for the study of protein--ligand interactions, not only for covalent complexes, where the use of MS is well established, but also, and significantly for protein--ligand interactions, for noncovalent assemblies. In this review, we employ a broad definition of a ligand to encompass protein subunits, drug molecules, oligonucleotides, carbohydrates, and lipids. Under the appropriate conditions, MS can reveal the composition, heterogeneity and dynamics of these protein--ligand interactions, and in some cases their structural arrangements and binding affinities. Herein, we highlight MS approaches for studying protein--ligand complexes, including those containing integral membrane subunits, and showcase examples from recent literature. Specifically, we tabulate the myriad of methodologies, including hydrogen exchange, proteomics, hydroxyl radical footprinting, intact complexes, and crosslinking, which, when combined with MS, provide insights into conformational changes and subtle modifications in response to ligand-binding interactions.},

Decentralised gambling applications are distinguished from traditional online casinos in that players use cryptocurrency as a stake. Also, rather than being stored on a single centralised server, decentralised gambling applications are stored on a cryptocurrency's blockchain. Previous work in the player behaviour tracking literature has examined the spending profiles of gamblers on traditional online casinos. However, similar work has not taken place in the decentralised gambling domain. The profile of gamblers on decentralised gambling applications are therefore unknown. This paper explores 2,232,741 transactions from 24,234 unique addresses to three such applications operating atop the Ethereum cryptocurrency network over 583 days. We present spending profiles across these applications, providing the first detailed summary of spending behaviours in this technologically advanced domain. We find that the typical player spends approximately \$110 equivalent across a median of 6 bets in a single day, although heavily involved bettors spend approximately \$100,000 equivalent over a median of 644 bets across 35 days. Our findings suggest that the average decentralised gambling application player spends less than in other online casinos overall, but that the most heavily involved players in this new domain spend substantially more. This study also demonstrates the use of these applications as a research platform, specifically for large scale longitudinal in-vivo data analysis.},

Previous works in this direction often rely on the existence of isolated minimizers with positive definite second variation. By adopting techniques from field theory and explicitly evaluating the large deviation prefactors as functional determinant ratios using Forman's theorem, we extend the approach to general systems where degenerate submanifolds of minimizers exist. The key technique for this is a boundary-type regularization of the second variation operator. This extension is particularly relevant if the system possesses continuous symmetries that are broken by the instantons. We find that removing the vanishing eigenvalues associated with the zero modes is possible within the Riccati formulation and amounts to modifying the initial or final conditions and evaluation of the Riccati matrices. We apply our results in multiple examples including a dynamical phase transition for the average surface height in short-time large deviations of the one-dimensional Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation with flat initial profile.},

An example of a complicated aggregation system with several levels of structures is peptide/protein self-assembly. The problem of protein aggregation is important for the understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and also for the development of bio-macromolecules as new materials. We write the effective Hamiltonian in terms of interaction energies between protein monomers, protein and solvent, as well as between protein filaments. The grand partition function can be expressed in terms of a Zimm-Bragg-like transfer matrix, which is calculated exactly and all thermodynamic properties can be obtained. We start with two-state and three-state descriptions of protein monomers using Potts models that can be generalized to include q-states, for which the exactly solvable feature of the model remains. We focus on n X N lattice systems, corresponding to the ordered structures observed in some real fibrils. We have obtained results on nucleation processes and phase diagrams, in which a protein property such as the sheet content of aggregates is expressed as a function of the number of proteins on the lattice and inter-protein or interfacial interaction energies. We have applied our methods to A\textbraceleft\textbackslash beta\textbraceright (1-40) and Curli fibrils and obtained results in good agreement with experiments.},

Globally, anomalous diffusion emerges through action of the generalized central limit theorem leading to scale-free forms of the jump length or waiting time distributions. Here we present a modified version of recently proposed correlated CTRW processes, where we incorporate a power-law correlated noise on the level of both jump length and waiting time dynamics. We obtain a very general stochastic model, that encompasses key features of several paradigmatic models of anomalous diffusion: discontinuous, scale-free displacements as in Levy flights, scale-free waiting times as in subdiffusive CTRWs, and the long-range temporal correlations of fractional Brownian motion (FBM). We derive the exact solutions for the single-time probability density functions and extract the scaling behaviours. Interestingly, we find that different combinations of the model parameters lead to indistinguishable shapes of the emerging probability density functions and identical scaling laws. Our model will be useful to describe recent experimental single particle tracking data, that feature a combination of CTRW and FBM properties.},

Given a population of spatially distributed synapses, each of which has a fixed number of slots, we calculate the rate of relaxation to the steady-state distribution of bound slots (synaptic weights) in terms of a set of local accumulation times. Assuming that the rates of exocytosis and endocytosis are sufficiently slow, we show that the steady-state synaptic weights are independent of each other (purely local). On the other hand, the local accumulation time of a given synapse depends on the number of slots and the spatial location of all the synapses, indicating a form of transient heterosynaptic plasticity. This suggests that local accumulation time measurements could provide useful information regarding the distribution of synaptic weights within a dendrite.},

  abstract = {The study of the diffusive motion of ions or molecules in confined biological microdomains requires the derivation of the explicit dependence of quantities, such as the decay rate of the population or the forward chemical reaction rate constant on the geometry of the domain. Here, we obtain this explicit dependence for a model of a Brownian particle (ion, molecule, or protein) confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape. We call the calculation of the mean escape time the narrow escape problem. This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a singular perturbation problem. Here, we present asymptotic formulas for the mean escape time in several cases, including regular domains in two and three dimensions and in some singular domains in two dimensions. The mean escape time comes up in many applications, because it represents the mean time it takes for a molecule to hit a target binding site. We present several applications in cellular biology: calcium decay in dendritic spines, a Markov model of multicomponent chemical reactions in microdomains, dynamics of receptor diffusion on the surface of neurons, and vesicle trafficking inside a cell.},

  abstract = {A mathematical formulation of Darwin's theory of evolutionary optimization through variation and selection is derived in terms of conventional ODEs that can be interpreted as chemical kinetics of evolution. Variation in form of mutation and recombination operates on genotypes being DNA or RNA sequences, whereas phenotypes, which are represented by organisms or molecular structures, are the target of selection. The impact of recombination on optimization is briefly sketched. Differential equations modeling selection in populations with correct replication and mutation are derived from the molecular mechanisms of polynucleotide replication. The analysis of these ODEs reveals restrictions of the optimization principle caused by mutation. Error propagation over generations sets a limit to mutation rates in evolution, which manifests itself in the form of a phase transition-like phenomenon characterized as error threshold. Conditions on fitness landscapes for the occurrence of error thresholds derived from numerical investigations are presented: Smooth fitness landscapes show no error thresholds but gradual transitions, sufficiently steep landscapes and rugged landscapes sustain error thresholds. Sharp transitions are also found with realistic landscapes combining ruggedness and neutrality. Lethal mutants may lead to extinction of populations and set another upper limit to mutation rates in form of an extinction threshold through lethal mutagenesis.

Special focus fixes upon physical mechanisms that have been little exploited up to now, but show significant promise as new means for controlling defect behavior, including low-energy ion bombardment, surface chemistry, and photostimulation.

Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) technology alone covers the entire widespread spectrum of functionalization possibilities. PEMs are obtained through the alternating deposition of polyanions and polycations on a substrate, and the great advantages of PEMs are that (i) they can be applied to almost any type of substrate whatever its shape and composition; (ii) various chemical, physicochemical, and mechanical properties of the coatings can be obtained; and (iii) active compounds can be embedded and released in a controlled manner. In this article we will give an overview of the field of PEMs applied to the design of antimicrobial coatings, illustrating the large versatility of the PEM technology.},

  abstract = {For millimeter-scale aquatic crustaceans such as copepods, ensuring reproductive success is a challenge as potential mates are often separated by hundreds of body lengths in a 3D environment. At the evolutionary scale, this led to the development of remote sensing abilities and behavioral strategies to locate, to track, and to capture a mate. Chemoreception plays a crucial role in increasing mate encounter rates through pheromone clouds and pheromone trails that can be followed over many body lengths. Empirical evidence of trail following behavior is, however, limited to laboratory experiments conducted in still water. An important open question concerns what happens in the turbulent waters of the surface ocean. We propose that copepods experience, and hence react to, a bulk-phase water pheromone concentration. Here we investigate the mating behavior of two key copepod species, Temora longicornis and Eurytemora affinis, to assess the role of background pheromone concentration and the relative roles played by males and females in mating encounters. We find that both males and females react to background pheromone concentration and exhibit both innate and acquired components in their mating strategies. The emerging swimming behaviors have stochastic properties that depend on pheromone concentration, sex, and species, are related to the level of reproductive experience of the individual tested, and significantly diverge from both the L\'evy and Brownian models identified in predators searching for low- and high-density prey. Our results are consistent with an adaptation to increase mate encounter rates and hence to optimize reproductive fitness and success.},

  abstract = {Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a bifunctional mitochondrial flavoprotein critical for energy metabolism and induction of caspase-independent apoptosis, whose exact role in normal mitochondria remains unknown. Upon reduction with NADH, AIF undergoes dimerization and forms tight, long-lived FADH2-NAD charge-transfer complexes (CTC) that are proposed to be functionally important. To obtain a deeper insight into structure/function relations and redox mechanism of this vitally important protein, we determined the X-ray structures of oxidized and NADH-reduced forms of naturally folded recombinant murine AIF. Our structures reveal that CTC with the pyridine nucleotide is stabilized by (i) {$\pi$}-stacking interactions between coplanar nicotinamide, isoalloxazine, and Phe309 rings; (ii) rearrangement of multiple aromatic residues in the C-terminal domain, likely serving as an electron delocalization site; and (iii) an extensive hydrogen-bonding network involving His453, a key residue that undergoes a conformational switch to directly interact with and optimally orient the nicotinamide for charge transfer. Via the His453-containing peptide, redox changes in the active site are transmitted to the surface, promoting AIF dimerization and restricting access to a primary nuclear localization signal through which the apoptogenic form is transported to the nucleus. Structural findings agree with biochemical data and support the hypothesis that both normal and apoptogenic functions of AIF are controlled by NADH.},

  abstract = {Decapod crustaceans, like many other animals, engage in agonistic behaviors that enhance their ability to compete for resources with conspecifics. These agonistic behaviors include the release of chemical signals as well as physical aggressive and submissive behaviors. In this study, we report that Caribbean spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, use both urine-borne chemical signaling and physical aggressive behaviors during interactions with conspecifics, and that these agonistic behaviors can influence the behavior and eventual social status of the interactants. Spiny lobsters that engaged primarily in physical aggressive behaviors became dominant, whereas spiny lobsters that received these physical aggressive behaviors responded with avoidance behaviors and became subordinates. Dominant animals frequently released urine during social interactions, more than when they were not in contact with subordinates and more than when they were not paired with another animal. Subordinates released urine significantly less often than dominants, and no more than when not paired. Preventing release of urine by catheterizing the animals resulted in an increase in the number and duration of physical interactions, and this increase was primarily driven by dominants initiating interactions through physical aggressive behaviors. Introducing urine from one of the catheterized animals into an aquarium reduced physical aggressive behavior by dominant animals to normal levels. Urine-borne signals alone were capable of inducing avoidance behaviors from solitary spiny lobsters in both laboratory and field conditions. We conclude that urine serves as a chemical signal that communicates social status to the interactants. Ablation experiments showed that that these urine signals are detected primarily by aesthetasc sensilla of the olfactory pathway.},

The diversity of the methods and the challenges in modeling active matter---ranging from molecular motors and cytoskeletal filaments over artificial and biological swimmers on microscopic to groups of animals on macroscopic scales---mainly originate from their out-of-equilibrium character, multiscale nature, nonlinearity, and multibody interactions. In the present review, various modeling approaches and numerical techniques are addressed, compared, and differentiated to illuminate the innovations and current challenges in understanding active matter. The complexity increases from minimal microscopic models of dry active matter toward microscopic models of active matter in fluids. Complementary, coarse-grained descriptions and continuum models are elucidated. Microscopic details are often relevant and strongly affect collective behaviors, which implies that the selection of a proper level of modeling is a delicate choice, with simple models emphasizing universal properties and detailed models capturing specific features. Finally, current approaches to further advance the existing models and techniques to cope with real-world applications, such as complex media and biological environments, are discussed.},

We obtained insight into this process by developing atomic models for no-nucleotide and ATP states of the monomeric kinesin motor domain on microtubules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5--6 \AA{} resolution. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, we infer a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment, mediated by a universally conserved `linchpin' residue in kinesin (N255), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft in a manner that tightly couples to translocation of cargo, via kinesin's `neck linker' element. These structural transitions are reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in the myosin and F1-ATPase motors and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer `gate' each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules.},

We present the algorithms in general setting such that they can be used to solve general linear parabolic partial differential equations with second-order sticky boundary condition via the probabilistic representations of their solutions. Since the sticky diffusion spends non-zero amount of time on boundary, it poses extra challenge in designing the schemes and obtaining their order of convergence.

Degree distributions are altered, and the average distance from a node to the nearest infective increases. The rewiring leads to regions of bistability where either an endemic or a disease-free steady state can exist. Fluctuations around the endemic state and the lifetime of the endemic state are considered. The fluctuations are found to exhibit power law behavior.},

We show that vaccine control is much more effective in adaptive networks than in static networks due to feedback interaction between the adaptive network rewiring and the vaccine application. When compared to extinction rates in static social networks, we find that the amount of vaccine resources required to sustain similar rates of extinction are as much as two orders of magnitude lower in adaptive networks.},

Multi-enzyme catalysis, which can accomplish the tandem synthesis of valuable materials/chemicals from renewable feedstocks, establishes a bridge between single-enzyme catalysis and whole-cell catalysis. Multi-enzyme catalysis occupies a unique and indispensable position in the realm of biological reactions for energy and environmental applications. Two complementary strategies,               i.e.               , compartmentalization and substrate channeling, have been evolved by living organisms for implementing the complex               in vivo               multi-enzyme reactions (MERs), which have been applied to construct multi-enzyme catalytic systems (MECSs) with superior catalytic activity and stabilities in practical biocatalysis.

The designs are hyper-stable, bind human and mouse IL-2R{$\beta\gamma$}c with higher affinity than the natural cytokines, and elicit downstream cell signalling independently of IL-2R{$\alpha$} and IL-15R{$\alpha$}. Crystal structures of the optimized design neoleukin-2/15 (Neo-2/15), both alone and in complex with IL-2R{$\beta\gamma$}c, are very similar to the designed model. Neo-2/15 has superior therapeutic activity to IL-2 in mouse models of melanoma and colon cancer, with reduced toxicity and undetectable immunogenicity. Our strategy for building hyper-stable de novo mimetics could be applied generally to signalling proteins, enabling the creation of superior therapeutic candidates.},

  abstract = {Movement is a key spatiotemporal process that enables interactions between animals and other elements of nature. The understanding of animal trajectories and the mechanisms that influence them at the landscape level can yield insight into ecological processes and potential solutions to specific ecological problems. Based upon optimal foraging models and empirical evidence, we hypothesized that movement by thrushes is highly tortuous (low average movement speeds and homogeneous distribution of turning angles) inside forests, moderately tortuous in urban areas, which present intermediary levels of resources, and minimally tortuous (high movement speeds and turning angles next to 0 radians) in open matrix types (e.g., crops and pasture). We used data on the trajectories of two common thrush species (Turdus rufiventris and Turdus leucomelas) collected by radio telemetry in a fragmented region in Brazil. Using a maximum likelihood model selection approach we fit four probability distribution models to average speed data, considering short-tailed, long-tailed, and scale-free distributions (to represent different regimes of movement variation), and one distribution to relative angle data. Models included land cover type and distance from forest-matrix edges as explanatory variables. Speed was greater farther away from forest edges and increased faster inside forest habitat compared to urban and open matrices. However, turning angle was not influenced by land cover. Thrushes presented a very tortuous trajectory, with many displacements followed by turns near 180 degrees. Thrush trajectories resembled habitat and edge dependent, tortuous random walks, with a well-defined movement scale inside each land cover type. Although thrushes are habitat generalists, they showed a greater preference for forest edges, and thus may be considered edge specialists. Our results reinforce the importance of studying animal movement patterns in order to understand ecological processes such as seed dispersal in fragmented areas, where the percentage of remaining habitat is dwindling.},

  abstract = {We report here the first evidence of faunistic equilibrium obtained through controlled, replicated experiments, together with an analysis of the immigration and extinction processes of animal species based on direct observations. The colonization of six small mangrove islands in Florida Bay by terrestrial arthropods was monitored at frequent intervals for 1 year after removal of the original fauna by methyl bromide fumigation. Both the observed data and climatic considerations imply that seasonality had little effect upon the basic shape of the colonization curves of species present vs. time. By 250 days after defaunation, the faunas of all the islands except the most distant one ('EI') had regained species numbers and composition similar to those of untreated islands even though population densities were still abnormally low. Although early colonists included both weak and strong fliers, the former, particularly psocopterans, were usually the first to produce large populations. Among these same early invaders were the taxa displaying both the highest extinction rates and the greatest variability in species composition on the different islands. Ants, the ecological dominants of mangrove islands, were among the last to colonize, but they did so with highest degree of predictability. The colonization curves plus static observations on untreated islands indicate strongly that a dynamic equilibrium number of species exists for any island. We believe the curves are produced by colonization involving little if any interaction, then a gradual decline as interaction becomes important, and finally, a lasting dynamic equilibrium. Equations are given for the early immigration, extinction, and colonization curves. Dispersal to these islands is predominantly through aerial transport, both active and passive. Extinction of the earliest colonists is probably caused chiefly by such physical factors as drowning or lack of suitable breeding sites and less commonly by competition and predation. As population sizes increase it is expected that competition and predation will become more important. Observed turnover rates showed wide variance, with most values between 0.05 and 0.50 species/day. True turnover rates are probably much higher, with 0.67 species/day the extreme lower limit on any island. This very high value is at least roughly consistent with the turnover equation derived from the MacArthur---Wilson equilibrium model, which predicts turnover rates on the order of 0.1---1.0 species/day on the experimental islands.},

This process is modelled as a random walk in a layered one-dimensional material, where each layer has a distinct particle hopping rate. Particles are released at some location, and the duration of time taken for each particle to reach an absorbing boundary is recorded. To explore whether these data can be used to identify the hopping rates in each layer, we compute various profile likelihoods using two methods: first, an exact likelihood is evaluated using a relatively expensive Markov chain approach; and, second, we form an approximate likelihood by assuming the distribution of exit times is given by a Gamma distribution whose first two moments match the moments from the continuum limit description of the stochastic model. Using the exact and approximate likelihoods, we construct various profile likelihoods for a range of problems. In cases where parameter values are not identifiable, we make progress by re-interpreting those data with a reduced model with a smaller number of layers.},

In contrast to the classic model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average trap size as a proxy, we identify a new trapping transition that replaces the classical percolation transition. This transition occurs at a threshold density \$\textbackslash rho\_* \textbackslash approx 0.55\$ and separates two qualitatively distinct trapping regimes: a self-trapping regime at low density, where the walker becomes dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping regime at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement of obstacles.},

Whereas there have been in vitro studies of how motors function at the single-molecule level, and in vivo studies of the structure of filamentary networks, studies of how the motors effectively use the networks for transportation have been lacking. We investigate how the combined system of myosin-V motors plus actin filaments is used to transport pigment granules in Xenopus melanophores. Experimentally, we characterize both the actin filament network, and how this transport is altered in response to external signals. We then develop a theoretical formalism to explain these changes. We show that cells regulate transport by controlling how often granules switch from one filament to another, rather than by altering individual motor activity at the single-molecule level, or by relying on structural changes in the network.},

We construct a coarse-grained description of the model that predicts this transition to be a first-order liquid-gas transition in the temperature-density ensemble, with a critical density sent to infinity. In this first-order phase transition, the magnetization is proportional to the liquid fraction and thus varies continuously throughout the phase diagram. Using microscopic simulations, we show that this theoretical prediction holds in 2D whereas the fluctuations alter the transition in 1D, preventing, for instance, any spontaneous symmetry breaking.},

Understanding biopolymer growth dynamics is essential for the description of the mechanisms and principles of cellular functions. These biopolymers are composed of N parallel protofilaments which are aligned with arbitrary but fixed relative displacements, thus giving rise to complex end structures. We have investigated rigid biopolymer growth processes by Monte Carlo simulations by taking into account the effects of such ``end'' properties and lateral interactions. Our simulations reproduce analytical results for the case of N=2, which is biologically relevant for actin filaments. For the case of N=13, which applies to microtubules, the simulations produced results qualitatively similar to the N=2 case. The simulation results indicate that polymerization events are evenly distributed among the N protofilaments, which imply that both end-structure effects and lateral interactions are significant. The effect of different splittings in activation energy has been investigated for the case of N=2. The effects of activation energy coefficients on the specific polymerization and depolymerization processes were found to be unsubstantial. By expanding the model, we have also obtained a force-velocity relationship of microtubules as observed in experiments. In addition, a range of lateral free-energy parameters was found that yields growth velocities in accordance with experimental observations and previous simulation estimates for the case of N=13.},

Such mobility on tubular membranes is critical, as it allows A{$\beta$} chains to oligomerize and elongate into fibrils. Factors such as cholesterol that favor A{$\beta$} chains with sufficient surface residence time can promote the inter-A{$\beta$} interaction and enhance A{$\beta$} fibrillation. This study provides previously uncharacterized insights into the chain behaviors of A{$\beta$} along important biological nanowire structures, which is essential to understanding and exploring the factors of cellular shapes to manipulate peptide amyloidosis.},

In contrast, when targets are easily found, a simple Brownian random walk strategy is enough. But where is the threshold between these two scenarios and when is optimization really necessary? We address this considering the interplay between two essential scales in random search, the average distance between neighbor targets l(0) and the detection capability r(v). In the limit cases the ratio beta=r(v)/l(0) suffices to characterize the problem. For low (high) beta a superdiffusive behavior is (is not) crucial for the process optimization. However, there is a crossover range, which is a nontrivial function of r(v) and l(0), separating the two regimes. We analyze this intermediate region, common in nature, and discuss the often overlooked important trade between resources availability and the searcher location power. Our results highlight contexts where efficient random search is a key factor for survival, such as in animal foraging.},

The chemotaxis network of E. coli has developed over the years into one of the most thoroughly studied model systems for signal transduction and behavior, yielding general insights into such properties of cellular networks as signal amplification, signal integration, and robustness. Despite its relative simplicity, the operation of the E. coli chemotaxis network is highly refined and evolutionarily optimized at many levels. For example, recent studies revealed that the network adjusts its signaling properties dependent on the extracellular environment, apparently to optimize chemotaxis under particular conditions. The network can even utilize potentially detrimental stochastic fluctuations in protein levels and reaction rates to maximize the chemotactic performance of the population.},

  abstract = {THE ability of populations to absorb perturbations is often investigated theoretically by some variant on the prey-predator, Lotka--Volterra, equations. Usually the treatment is in terms of linearised equations and thus deals with very small perturbations from a steady state. Recently, May1 has enlarged the scope of investigation by considering perturbations from limit cycles rather than divergence from the simple steady state. This theoretical approach assumes populations uniform in space if not in time, but much of the variability found in nature is not only in large temporal cycles but in smaller-scale spatial patchiness. This variability may be handled statistically to give, for some specified area, a mean and variance for the populations. These can be used for `sensitivity analysis' of the output from a theory or computer model, or as a basis for stochastic treatment. In either case this variability, as a function of changes in space, is not an intrinsic part of the model. Yet much experimental work shows that populations of prey or predator with limited abilities to disperse can produce spatially heterogeneous patterns, and the scale and complexity of these patterns may have some effect on persistence of these populations2,3.},

  abstract = {Some simple stochastic models of optimal foraging are considered. Firstly, mathematical re-newal theory is used to make a general model of the combined processes of search, encounter, capture and handling. In the case where patches or prey items are encountered according to a Poisson pro-cess the limiting probability distribution of energy gain is found. This distribution is found to be nor-mal and its mean and variance are specified. This result supports the use of Holling's disc equation to specify the rate of energy intake in foraging models. Secondly, a model based on minimization of the probability of death due to an energetic shortfall is presented. The model gives a graphical solution to the problem of optimal choices when mean and variance are related. Thirdly, a worked example using these results is presented. This example sug-gests that there may be natural relationships be-tween mean and variance which make solutions to the problems of 'energy maximization' and 'minimi-zation of the probability of starvation' similar. Fi-nally, current trends in stochastic modeling of forag-ing behavior are critically discussed. by representing distributions of random variables by their expectations (or mean values). However, stochastic models have an important place in optimal foraging theory for three reasons. 1. Many biologically important phenomena are fundamentally stochastic, so that deterministic mod-els do not make sense (e.g. sampling). 2. Stochastic models can be compared to deter-ministic models to tell us how good, as approxi-mations, these simpler models are. This comparison is useful both for models of inherently stochastic problems as well as for models that can reasonably be modeled deterministically. 3. Conversion of deterministic to stochastic mod-els by replacing deterministic variables with expec-tations of random variables may be inappropriate because characteristics of the random distribution other than the expectation may be critical; for ex-ample, both expectation and variance of food intake may be important. The most valuable stochastic models may be use-ful in all three (or other) ways. To make this clear we give examples of these uses of stochastic models below.},

  abstract = {Despite their long history in experiment, simulation, and analytical theory, pair correlation functions that describe local order in many-body systems still retain a legacy of mathematical mysteries. One such open question concerns "realizability" of a given candidate pair correlation function, namely whether it actually represents the pair correlation for some spatial distribution of particles at number density {$\rho$} \textbackslash textgreater0. Several necessary conditions that must be satisfied by the candidate are known, including nonnegativity of the function and its associated structure factor, as well as constraints on implied local density fluctuations. However, general conditions sufficient to ensure realizability are not known. To clarify this situation, we have examined realizability for a simple one-dimensional lattice model, with single-site occupancy, and nearest-neighbor exclusion. By virtue of exhaustive enumeration for systems of 15 or fewer sites subject to periodic boundary conditions, several conclusions have been formulated for the case of a constant pair correlation beyond the exclusion range. These include (a) pair correlation realizability over a nonzero density range, (b) violation of the Kirkwood superposition approximation for many such realizations, and (c) inappropriateness of the socalled "reverse Monte Carlo" method that uses a candidate pair correlation function as a means to suggest typical many-body configurations.},

The representation of and mechanism for this information exchange and the control algorithms that utilize this information are the key components of autonomous multi-vehicle control. The use of stigmergic potential fields (SPF) and distributed control algorithms to realize adaptive, cooperative behaviors within the context of feature-rich GPS-denied environments is the focus of this paper.

  abstract = {The biological processes necessary for the development and continued survival of any organism are often strongly influenced by the transport properties of various biologically active species. The transport phenomena involved vary over multiple temporal and spatial scales, from organism-level behaviors such as the search for food, to systemic processes such as the transport of oxygen from the lungs to distant organs, down to microscopic phenomena such as the stochastic movement of proteins in a cell. Each of these processes is influenced by many interrelated factors. Identifying which factors are the most important, and how they interact to determine the overall result is a problem of great importance and interest. Experimental observations are often fit to relatively simple models, but in reality the observations are the output of complicated functions of the physicochemical, topological, and geometrical properties of a given system. Herein we use multistate continuous-time random walks and generalized master equations to model transport processes involving spatial jumps, immobilization at defined sites, and stochastic internal state changes. The underlying spatial models, which are framed as graphs, may have different classes of nodes, and walkers may have internal states that are governed by a Markov process. A general form of the solutions, using Fourier--Laplace transforms and asymptotic analysis, is developed for several spatially infinite regular lattices in one and two spatial dimensions, and the theory is developed for the analysis of transport and internal state changes on general graphs. The goal in each case is to shed light on how experimentally observable macroscale transport coefficients can be explained in terms of microscale properties of the underlying processes. This work is motivated by problems arising in transport in biological tissues, but the results are applicable to a broad class of problems that arise in other applications.},

At earlier times, the fluctuation spectrum is dominated by strong non-Gaussian fluctuations, which arise from large displacements. At later times, directed displacements are infrequent and finally disappear. We show that these effects are due to contractile coarsening of the network into large actin-myosin foci.},

As a result, exact analytic expressions for growth velocity and dispersion are obtained for any number of protofilaments and arbitrary geometry of the growing end of the biopolymer. Our theoretical predictions are compared with a full description of biopolymer growth dynamics for the simplest N=2 model. It is found that the results from the approximate theory are approaching the exact ones for large lateral interactions between the protofilaments.

Exact analytical expressions are obtained for the mean growth velocity, for the dispersion in the length fluctuations, and the nucleotide composition of the actin filaments. It is found that the ATP hydrolysis has a strong effect on dynamic properties of single actin filaments. At high concentrations of free actin monomers, the mean size of the unhydrolyzed ATP-cap is very large, and the dynamics is governed by association/dissociation of ATP-actin subunits. However, at low concentrations the size of the cap becomes finite, and the dissociation of ADP-actin subunits makes a significant contribution to overall dynamics. Actin filament length fluctuations reach a sharp maximum at the boundary between two dynamic regimes, and this boundary is always larger than the critical concentration for the actin filament's growth at the barbed end, assuming the sequential release of phosphate. Random and sequential mechanisms of hydrolysis are compared, and it is found that they predict qualitatively similar dynamic properties at low and high concentrations of free actin monomers with some deviations near the critical concentration. The possibility of attachment and detachment of oligomers in actin filament's growth is also discussed. Our theoretical approach is successfully applied to analyze the latest experiments on the growth and length fluctuations of individual actin filaments.},

At variance with a previous publication, where gold-tagged {$\mu$}OR was found to be totally confined within a domain, which in turn underwent very slow diffusion itself, we found that {$\mu$}OR undergoes rapid hop diffusion over membrane compartments (210-nm and 730-nm nested double compartments in the case of normal rat kidney cell line), which are likely delimited by the actin-based membrane-skeleton ``fence or corrals'' and its associated transmembrane protein ``pickets'', at a rate comparable to that for transferrin receptor (every 45 and 760ms on average, respectively), suggesting that the fence and picket models may also be applicable to G-protein coupled receptors. Further, we found that strong confinement of gold-labeled {$\mu$}OR could be induced by the prolonged on-ice preincubation of the gold probe with the cells, showing that this procedure should be avoided in future single-particle tracking experiments. Based on the dense, long trajectories of {$\mu$}OR obtained by high-speed single-particle tracking, the membrane compartments apposed and adjoined to each other could be defined that are delimited by rather straight boundaries, consistent with the involvement of actin filaments in membrane compartmentalization.},

  abstract = {Planning agencies increasingly use pavement management systems (PMS) to determine an optimal preservation strategy for their roadway assets. To develop cost-effective resource allocation policies, it is important that a PMS embed pavement degradation models that accurately depict its progression over time. Presently, PMS frameworks use two broad classes of methods (Markov chains and simplified, trend-stationary regression models) to project pavement degradation. These approaches make contradictory assumptions regarding (1)~the degree to which variation is aleatory/epistemic, and (2)~the long-term persistence of sudden changes in pavement distress. Consequently, this research constructs a panel data variance ratio test to evaluate if pavement degradation conforms to a hypothesis that convolves the assumptions of the two prevailing approaches: a random walk with drift that captures relevant exogenous information. The authors apply their model to publicly available data on pavement roughness, one pavement distress mechanism of primary interest to planners, as part of the Federal Highway Administration's Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program. The case study results are unable to reject the null hypothesis that pavement roughness follows a random walk with drift, a model structure that contradicts the current assumptions of PMS platforms. The methods developed by the authors offer decision makers an opportunity to augment their current PMS approaches, because the misspecification of pavement degradation will cause such decision-support tools to select suboptimal allocation policies.},

We review both modeling strategies, starting with Langevin's approach to a mechanistic description of the Brownian motion in free fluid of a point-size inert particle and establishing its relation to Fick's diffusion equation. Next, we discuss its generalizations which account for a finite number of finite-size particles, particle's electric charge, and chemical interactions between diffusing particles. That is followed by introduction of models of molecular diffusion in the presence of geometric constraints (e.g., the Knudsen and Fick--Jacobs diffusion); when these constraints are imposed by the solid matrix of a porous medium, the resulting equations provide a pore-scale representation of diffusion. Next, we discuss phenomenological Darcy-scale descriptors of pore-scale diffusion and provide a few examples of other processes whose Darcy-scale models take the form of linear or nonlinear diffusion equations. Our review is concluded with a discussion of field-scale models of non-Fickian diffusion.},

  abstract = {Crime reduction and prevention strategies are vital for policymakers and law enforcement to face inevitable increases in urban crime rates as a side ef1'ect of the projected growth of urban population by the year 2030. Studies conclude that crime does not occur uniformly across urban landscapes but concen\- trates in certain areas. This phenomenon has drawn attention to spatial crime analysis, primarily focusing on crime hotspots, areas with disproportionally higher crime density. In this paper we present CRIMETRACER, a personalized random walk based approach to spatial crime analysis and crime location prediction outside of hotspots. We propose a probabilistic model of spatial behavior of known ofl'enders within their activity space. Crime Pattern Theory concludes that offenders, rather than venture into unknown territory, frequently commit opportunistic crimes and serial violent crimes by taking advantage of opportunities they encounter in places they are most familiar with as part of their activity space. Our experiments on a large real-world crime dataset show that CRIMETRACER outperforms all other methods used for location recommendation we evaluate here.},

This bound is simply expressed in terms of the equilibrium distribution at the target and implies a minimal scaling of the GMFPT with the network size. We show that this minimal scaling, which can be arbitrarily slow, is realized under the simple condition that the random walk is transient at the target site and independently of the small-world, scale-free, or fractal properties of the network. Last, we put forward that the GMFPT to a specific target is not a representative property of the network since the target averaged GMFPT satisfies much more restrictive bounds.},

They facilitate the determination of the kinetics and mechanism of catalytic turnover---both experimentally and computationally---and make accessible the energetics of various intermediates (including short-lived transition states). These facts in turn offer a rational strategic principle for the design of new catalysts and the improvement of existing ones. It is generally possible to prepare soluble molecular fragments that circumscribe the single-site, thus enabling a direct comparison to be made, experimentally, between the catalytic performance of the same active site when functioning as a heterogeneous (continuous solid) as well as a homogeneous (dispersed molecular) catalyst. This approach also makes it possible to modify the immediate atomic environment as well as the central atomic structure of the active site. From the practical standpoint, SSHC exhibit very high selectivities leading to the production of sharply defined molecular products, just as do their homogeneous analogues. Given that mesoporous silicas with very large internal surface areas are ideal supports for SSHC, and that more than a quarter of the elements of the Periodic Table may be grafted as active sites onto such silicas, there is abundant scope for creating new catalytic opportunities.},

In this paper we present a novel technique for this analysis, one based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM's). We assume that the actual path of the fish is generated by a biased random walk. The HMM methodology produces, for each time step, the probability that the fish resides in each grid cell. Because there is no Monte Carlo step in our technique, we are able to estimate parameters within the likelihood framework. The method does not require the distribution to be Gaussian or belong to any other of the usual families of distributions and can thus address constraints from shorelines and other nonlinear effects; the method can and does produce bimodal distributions. We discuss merits and limitations of the method, and perspectives for the more general problem of inference in state-space models of animals. The technique can be applied to geolocation based on light, on tidal patterns, or measurement of other variables that vary with space. We illustrate the method through application to a simulated data set where geolocation relies on depth data exclusively.},

  abstract = {Patterns of individual animal movement attracted considerable attention over the last two decades. In particular, question as to whether animal movement is predominantly diffusive or superdiffusive has been a focus of discussion and controversy. We consider this problem using a theory of stochastic motion based on the Langevin equation with non-Wiener stochastic forcing that originates in animal's response to environmental noise. We show that diffusive and superdiffusive types of motion are inherent parts of the same general movement process that arises as interplay between the force exerted by animals (essentially, by animal's muscles) and the environmental drag. The movement is superballistic with the mean square displacement growing with time as {$\sim$} x t t () 2 4 at the beginning and eventually slowing down to the diffusive spread {$\sim$} x t t () 2 . We show that the duration of the superballistic and superdiffusive stages can be long depending on the properties of the environmental noise and the intensity of drag. Our findings demonstrate theoretically how the movement pattern that includes diffusive and superdiffusive/superballistic motion arises naturally as a result of the interplay between the dissipative properties of the environment and the animal's biological traits such as the body mass, typical movement velocity and the typical duration of uninterrupted movement. Dispersal is a common property of all animal and plant species},

It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-{$\kappa$}B essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.},

Packing modes of proteins also affect their evolvability, and poorly packed, disordered, and conformationally diverse proteins may exhibit high evolvability. This dynamic view of protein structure, function, and evolvability is extrapolated to describe hypothetical scenarios for the evolution of the early proteins and future research directions in the area of protein dynamism and evolution.},

The resulting limit cycle is just a macroscopic manifestation of the dynamically directed property which is latent in the fluctuation below threshold.

The instabilities are classified into two types, i.e., hard- and soft-mode instabilities, by the use of the Floquet exponents which are, calculated by a non-perturbational method. The hard-mode instability corresponds to the limit of entrainment and the amplitude is subject to a modulation beyond the threshold. The frequency of modulation is estimated from the Floquet exponent, which is compared with the results of numerical computation. The soft-mode instabilitiy corresponds to a jump phenomenon in the amplitude. The smaller amplitude branch is liable to a modulation due to a superimposed hard-mode instability. As a whole, a reasonable agreement is obtained between numerical and theoretical results.},

It has been proposed that the growing MT ends are protected by a ``GTP cap'' that consists of GTP-bound tubulin dimers. When the speed of GTP hydrolysis is faster than dimer recruitment, the loss of this GTP cap will lead the MT to undergo rapid disassembly. However, the underlying atomistic mechanistic details of the dynamic instability remains unclear. In this study, we have performed long-time atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (1 ms for each system) for MT patches as well as a short segment of a closed MT in both GTP- and GDP-bound states. Our results confirmed that MTs in the GDP state generally have weaker lateral interactions between neighboring protofilaments (PFs) and less cooperative outward bending conformational change, where the difference between bending angles of neighboring PFs tends to be larger compared with GTP ones. As a result, when the GDP state tubulin dimer is exposed at the growing MT end, these factors will be more likely to cause the MT to undergo rapid disassembly. We also compared simulation results between the special MT seam region and the remaining material and found that the lateral interactions between MT PFs at the seam region were comparatively much weaker. This finding is consistent with the experimental suggestion that the seam region tends to separate during the disassembly process of an MT.},

  abstract = {Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells recognize endogenous and exogenous lipid antigens presented in the context of CD1d molecules. The ability of iNKT cells to recognize endogenous antigens represents a distinct immune recognition strategy, which underscores the constitutive memory phenotype of iNKT cells and their activation during inflammatory conditions. However, the mechanisms regulating such ``tonic'' activation of iNKT cells remain unclear. Here, we show that the spatiotemporal distribution of CD1d molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) modulates activation of iNKT cells. By using superresolution microscopy, we show that CD1d molecules form nanoclusters at the cell surface of APCs, and their size and density are constrained by the actin cytoskeleton. Dual-color single-particle tracking revealed that diffusing CD1d nanoclusters are actively arrested by the actin cytoskeleton, preventing their further coalescence. Formation of larger nanoclusters occurs in the absence of interactions between CD1d cytosolic tail and the actin cytoskeleton and correlates with enhanced iNKT cell activation. Importantly and consistently with iNKT cell activation during inflammatory conditions, exposure of APCs to the Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist R848 increases nanocluster density and iNKT cell activation. Overall, these results define a previously unidentified mechanism that modulates iNKT cell autoreactivity based on the tight control by the APC cytoskeleton of the sizes and densities of endogenous antigen-loaded CD1d nanoclusters.},

For example, such simulation methods have been used to study the electrophoresis of charged molecules in sieving gels and the separation of particles using ratchet systems. In the case of constant fields or low-frequency alternating fields, the Monte Carlo simulation method can be mapped onto a numerical or algebraic matrix problem that can be solved exactly. In this Rapid Communication, we generalize this matrix approach to treat periodic time-dependent fields. The evolution of the spatial distribution function during a period is computed using a sequence of transfer matrices, and a steady-state closure relation allows us to calculate the exact mean velocity of the particle during a complete cycle. As an example, we examine the properties of a simple spatially asymmetric ratchet system in the presence of periodic alternating fields (symmetric and asymmetric) as well as random telegraph signals.},

  abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

The ratio of new infections compared to sales efficiency (earned profit for customer purchases) was computed as a factor of customer density and social distance. Our results indicate that the social distance between customers is the primary factor influencing infection rate. Supermarket layout and purchasing strategy do not impact social distance and hence the spread of infection. Moreover, we found only a weak dependence of sales efficiency and customer density. We believe that our study will help to establish scientifically-based safety rules that will reduce the social price of supermarket business.},

Recently, investigators have proposed a method to image neural connectivity noninvasively using a magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI measures the molecular diffusion of water along neural pathways. Accurate reconstruction of neural connectivity patterns from DTI has been hindered, however, by the inability of DTI to resolve more than a single axon direction within each imaging voxel. Here, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique that can resolve multiple axon directions within a single voxel. The technique, called q-ball imaging, can resolve intravoxel white matter fiber crossing as well as white matter insertions into cortex. The ability of q-ball imaging to resolve complex intravoxel fiber architecture eliminates a key obstacle to mapping neural connectivity in the human brain noninvasively.},

  abstract = {The relationship between movement and population dynamics in heterogeneous environments has been approached from two directions: theoretical analyses using diffusion models and empirical studies that often employ computer simulations. In this paper I am proposing a unified framework for studying individual movements that brings both of these approaches together. The proposed framework is based on the diffusion---approximation' procedure developed by Patlak (1953a, b), which translates a probabilistic description of the pattern of individual movements (such as provided by simulation models) into a partial differential model describing the population redistribution in a patchy habitat. My first goal is this paper was to make Patlak's work accessible to ecologists interested in realistic movement models. Secondly, making some simplifying assumptions I solved Patlick's model to obtain the equilibrium distribution of organisms among patches in a heterogeneous environment. This led me to a definition of 'residence index.' The residence index of a patch is estimated by observing and recording movement trajectories of organisms within the patch. The pattern of variation in the residence index among different kinds of patches specifies the predicted equilibrium densities of organisms in each patch. I assessed the utility of the above approach by using data on movement tracks of Euphydryas anicia females to calculate butterfly residence indices in host---plant patches vs. nonhost environment. The predicted distribution of butterflies among host and nonhost areas differed by only 16\% from the actual distribution, as documented by an independent data set. I also applied the model to data from three studies on insect movement and spatial distribution. The accuracy of model predictions varied from adequate to excellent. Finally, I argue that Patlak's model and its residence---index extension provides a general, and at the same time realistic, framework for quantifying individual movements, and for relating movement patterns to spatial population dynamics. Although this approach, as developed here, is explicitly concerned only with population redistribution within an area, birth/death or immigration/emigration terms can be added in a straightforward manner. Thus, this framework can be very useful in studies of consumer---resource (e.g., predator---prey or herbivore---host) spatial dynamics, since movement behaviors of consumers searching for prey, and prey attempting to avoid consumers, are known to be important in affecting the outcome of such population interactions.},

Crystallography provides a high-resolution description of protein structure in the crystal environment, while NMR describes structure in solution but using less data. NMR structures display more variability, but is this because crystal contacts are absent or because of fewer data constraints? Here we report unexpected insight into this issue obtained through analysis of detailed protein energy landscapes generated by large-scale, native-enhanced sampling of conformational space with Rosetta@home for 111 protein domains. In the absence of tightly associating binding partners or ligands, the lowest-energy Rosetta models were nearly all {$<$}2.5~\AA{} C{$\alpha$}RMSD from the experimental structure; this result demonstrates that structure prediction accuracy for globular proteins is limited mainly by the ability to sample close to the native structure. While the lowest-energy models are similar to deposited structures, they are not identical; the largest deviations are most often in regions involved in ligand, quaternary, or crystal contacts. For ligand binding proteins, the low energy models may resemble the apo structures, and for oligomeric proteins, the monomeric assembly intermediates. The deviations between the low energy models and crystal structures largely disappear when landscapes are computed in the context of the crystal lattice or multimer. The computed low-energy ensembles, with tight crystal-structure-like packing in the core, but more NMR-structure-like variability in loops, may in some cases resemble the native state ensembles of proteins better than individual crystal or NMR structures, and can suggest experimentally testable hypotheses relating alternative states and structural heterogeneity to function.},

Boundary-preservation is ensured by the use of Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration.

  abstract = {We present a study of the coarse-graining of polymers into bead-spring chains using statistical mechanics. The force--extension behavior is examined at different levels of coarse-graining. A direct result of the springs being decoupled is that the force--extension behavior depends only on the number of flexibility lengths (e.g. persistence or Kuhn lengths) represented by each spring. This dimensionless parameter is found to govern the fluctuations around the mean extension, analogous to the conventional role of temperature. The use of an effective flexibility length to correct the model behavior is analyzed, and we have calculated bounds on the choices of this correction factor. The analytic nature of the statistical mechanical framework has also allowed for the calculation of asymptotic and universal behavior. The zero Weissenberg number rheological behavior is examined using the retarded-motion expansion coefficients of bead-spring chains at different levels of coarse-graining. The results show the trade-off between using too few or too many springs. The general framework to analyze the force--extension and rheological behavior is applied to the worm-like chain, FENE, and Fraenkel models. We introduce a new method for coarse-graining a polymer into a bead-spring chain called the Polymer Ensemble Transformation (PET) method. Application to the freely jointed chain polymer yields a set of spring force-laws called the Random Walk Spring (RWS) model.

  abstract = {The disappearance of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-tubulin cap is widely believed to be the forerunner event for the growth-shrinkage transition (`catastrophe') in microtubule filaments in eukaryotic cells. We study a discrete version of a stochastic model of the GTP cap dynamics, originally proposed by Flyvbjerg, Holy and Leibler (Flyvbjerg, Holy and Leibler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 2372, 1994). Our model includes both spontaneous and vectorial hydrolysis, as well as dissociation of a non-hydrolyzed dimer from the filament after incorporation. In the first part of the paper, we apply this model to a single protofilament of a microtubule. A catastrophe transition is defined for each protofilament, similar to the earlier one-dimensional models, the frequency of occurrence of which is then calculated under various conditions, but without explicit assumption of steady state conditions. Using a perturbative approach, we show that the leading asymptotic behavior of the protofilament catastrophe in the limit of large growth velocities is remarkably similar across different models. In the second part of the paper, we extend our analysis to the entire filament by making a conjecture that a minimum number of such transitions are required to occur for the onset of microtubule catastrophe. The frequency of microtubule catastrophe is then determined using numerical simulations, and compared with analytical/semi-analytical estimates made under steady state/quasi-steady state assumptions respectively for the protofilament dynamics. A few relevant experimental results are analyzed in detail, and compared with predictions from the model. Our results indicate that loss of GTP cap in 2-3 protofilaments is necessary to trigger catastrophe in a microtubule.},

However, few authors focused on the temporal unfolding of the susceptible individuals. In this paper, we study the dynamic of the susceptible--infected--recovered model in an adaptive network that mimics the transitory deactivation of permanent social contacts, such as friendship and work-ship ties. Using an edge-based compartmental model and percolation theory, we obtain the evolution equations for the fraction susceptible individuals in the susceptible biggest component. In particular, we focus on how the individual's behavior impacts on the dilution of the susceptible network. We show that, as a consequence, the spreading of the disease slows down, protecting the biggest susceptible cluster by increasing the critical time at which the giant susceptible component is destroyed. Our theoretical results are fully supported by extensive simulations.},

  abstract = {Generating a realistic model of subsurface stratigraphy that fits data from multiple well locations is a well-established problem in the field of aquifer characterisation. This is particularly critical for the alluvial fan-hosted aquifers in northwestern India, as they have some of the highest rates of groundwater extraction in the world and spatially limited subsurface observations. The objective of this study is to develop a reduced-complexity model that generates probabilistic estimates of aquifer body occurrence within a sedimentary fan, based loosely on the northwestern Indian aquifer system. We propose a parsimonious, inverse-weighted random walk model that reconstructs potential channel belt pathways within a discrete depth range or slice by (i) connecting known aquifer locations with the fan apex, (ii) filling adjacent cells with non-aquifer material based on estimated channel-body dimensions, and (iii) random filling of the remaining cells until the model fraction of aquifer material is comparable to the bulk aquifer fraction observed from well data. Once filled, individual depth slices can be stacked to produce a three-dimensional representation of aquifer-body geometry, allowing informed inference and testable predictions about the configuration of aquifer units in the subsurface. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows that the model performs better than fully random filling, both in matching the locations of aquifer material in the subsurface and in reconstructing the geometry of relict channel bodies preserved on the fan surface. The model differs from purely statistical-empirical approaches by incorporating some geomorphic knowledge of fluvial channel belt geometry within the fan system. In contrast to a fully process-based approach, the model is computationally fast and is easily refined as new subsurface data become available.},

In this paper, we used an IBM calibrated and evaluated from real data to represent the spatial dynamics of the banana weevil in relation to the cropping system. We considered crop fragmentation and mass trapping as tools for suppressing pest numbers. Our simulation results showed that manipulating crop residues in the area surrounding each pheromone trap greatly improved trap efficiency. For an intensive banana plantation in fallow, traps were most effective when situated at the transition zone between banana area and fallow so as to maximize the trapping of weevils escaping the fallow. The model also showed that weevil numbers decreased when fragmentation of banana plantations was reduced.},

It is often assumed in foraging theory that the flight lengths of a forager have a characteristic scale: from this assumption gaussian, Rayleigh and other classical distributions with well-defined variances have arisen. However, such theories cannot explain the long-tailed power-law distributions of flight lengths or flight times that are observed experimentally. Here we study how the search efficiency depends on the probability distribution of flight lengths taken by a forager that can detect target sites only in its limited vicinity. We show that, when the target sites are sparse and can be visited any number of times, an inverse square power-law distribution of flight lengths, corresponding to L\'evy flight motion, is an optimal strategy. We test the theory by analysing experimental foraging data on selected insect, mammal and bird species, and find that they are consistent with the predicted inverse square power-law distributions.},

To this end we began by discussing the rates expected for small molecules engaged in classical elastic collisions. We then proceeded to modify this picture by introducing first the features of inelastic macromolecular collisions in solution, then the effects of specific electrostatic fields set up around macromolecules of known structure at low ionic strengths, and finally the special rate enhancements available to DNA-protein interactions because of the particular geometry of the DNA molecule and the multiple conformations that can be assumed by the protein component. We hope that this exposition will help to clarify the subject for others and also will stimulate more focused examination of this type of problem, both in DNA-protein interaction systems and in other biological systems where such rate facilitation might apply.},

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

A long-standing design approach uses genetic fusion to join protein homo-oligomer subunits via {$\alpha$}-helical linkers to form more complex symmetric assemblies, but this method is hampered by linker flexibility and a dearth of geometric solutions. Here, we describe a general computational method for rigidly fusing homo-oligomer and spacer building blocks to generate user-defined architectures that generates far more geometric solutions than previous approaches. The fusion junctions are then optimized using Rosetta to minimize flexibility. We apply this method to design and test 92 dihedral symmetric protein assemblies using a set of designed homodimers and repeat protein building blocks. Experimental validation by native mass spectrometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy confirms the assembly states for 11 designs. Most of these assemblies are constructed from designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), held in place on one end by {$\alpha$}-helical fusion and on the other by a designed homodimer interface, and we explored their use for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination by incorporating DARPin variants selected to bind targets of interest. Although the target resolution was limited by preferred orientation effects and small scaffold size, we found that the dual anchoring strategy reduced the flexibility of the target-DARPIN complex with respect to the overall assembly, suggesting that multipoint anchoring of binding domains could contribute to cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins.},

  abstract = {The passive and active motion of micron-sized tracer particles in crowded liquids and inside living biological cells is ubiquitously characterised by `viscoelastic' anomalous diffusion, in which the increments of the motion feature long-ranged negative and positive correlations. While viscoelastic anomalous diffusion is typically modelled by a Gaussian process with correlated increments, so-called fractional Gaussian noise, an increasing number of systems are reported, in which viscoelastic anomalous diffusion is paired with non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Following recent advances in Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion we here introduce and discuss several possible versions of random-diffusivity models with long-ranged correlations. While all these models show a crossover from non-Gaussian to Gaussian distributions beyond some correlation time, their mean squared displacements exhibit strikingly different behaviours: depending on the model crossovers from anomalous to normal diffusion are observed, as well as a priori unexpected dependencies of the effective diffusion coefficient on the correlation exponent. Our observations of the non-universality of random-diffusivity viscoelastic anomalous diffusion are important for the analysis of experiments and a better understanding of the physical origins of `viscoelastic yet non-Gaussian' diffusion.},

  abstract = {The capability to analyze small RNAs responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of genes expression is essential for characterizing cellular phenotypes. Here, we describe an intracellular biopsy technique (inCell-Biopsy) for fast, multiplexed, and highly sensitive profiling of microRNAs (miRNAs). The technique uses an array of diamond nanoneedles that are functionalized with size-dependent RNA binding proteins, working as ``fishing rods'' to directly pull miRNAs out of cytoplasm while keeping the cells alive, thus enabling quasi-single-cell miRNA analysis. Each nanoneedle works as a reaction chamber for parallel in situ amplification, visualization, and quantification of miRNAs as low as femtomolar, which is sufficient to detect miRNAs of a single-copy intracellular abundance with specificity to single-nucleotide variation. Using inCell-Biopsy, we analyze the temporal miRNA transcriptome over the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The combinatorial miRNA expression patterns derived by inCell-Biopsy identify emerging cell subpopulations differentiated from ESCs and reveal the dynamic evolution of cellular heterogeneity.},

The FBM--SBM process is aging in a manner similar to SBM. The velocity autocorrelation function (ACF) of particle increments of FBM--SBM exhibits a dip when the parent FBM process is subdiffusive. Both for sub- and superdiffusive FBM contributions to the FBM--SBM process, the SBM exponent affects the long-time decay exponent of the ACF. Applications of the FBM--SBM-amalgamated process to the analysis of SPT data are discussed. A comparative tabulated overview of recent experimental (mainly SPT) and computational datasets amenable for interpretation in terms of FBM-, SBM-, and FBM--SBM-like models of diffusion culminates the presentation. The statistical aspects of the dynamics of a wide range of biological systems is compared in the table, from nanosized beads in living cells, to chromosomal loci, to water diffusion in the brain, and, finally, to patterns of animal movements.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

The statistics of records in symmetric random walks was previously analyzed by Majumdar and Ziff [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 050601 (2008)] and is well understood. Unlike the case of symmetric jump distributions, in the asymmetric case the statistics of records depends on the choice of the jump distribution. We compute the record rate Pn(c), defined as the probability for the nth value to be larger than all previous values, for a Gaussian jump distribution with standard deviation {$\sigma$} that is shifted by a constant drift c. For small drift, in the sense of c/{$\sigma\ll$}n-1/2, the correction to Pn(c) grows proportional to arctan(\textsurd n) and saturates at the value c\textsurd 2{$\sigma$}. For large n the record rate approaches a constant, which is approximately given by 1-({$\sigma$}/\textsurd 2{$\pi$}c)exp(-c2/2{$\sigma$}2) for c/{$\sigma\gg$}1. These asymptotic results carry over to other continuous jump distributions with finite variance. As an application, we compare our analytical results to the record statistics of 366 daily stock prices from the Standard \& Poor's 500 index. The biased random walk accounts quantitatively for the increase in the number of upper records due to the overall trend in the stock prices, and after detrending the number of upper records is in good agreement with the symmetric random walk. However the number of lower records in the detrended data is significantly reduced by a mechanism that remains to be identified.},

The explosion of miniature sensors that are driving the boom in consumer electronics, such as smart phones, gaming platforms, and wearable fitness devices, are now becoming available to ecologists for remotely monitoring the activities of wild animals. While half a century ago researchers were attaching balloons to the backs of seals to measure their movement, today ecologists have access to an arsenal of sensors that can continuously measure most aspects of an animal's state (e.g., location, behavior, caloric expenditure, interactions with other animals) and external environment (e.g., temperature, salinity, depth). This technology is advancing our ability to study animal ecology by allowing researchers to (1) answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of wild animals in situ that would have previously been limited to tests on model organisms in highly controlled settings, (2) study cryptic or wide-ranging animals that have previously evaded investigation, and (3) develop and test entirely new theories. Here we explore how ecologists are using these tools to answer new questions about the physiological performance, energetics, foraging, migration, habitat selection, and sociality of wild animals, as well as collect data on the environments in which they live.},

  abstract = {A living cell's interior is one of the most complex and intrinsically dynamic systems, providing an elaborate interplay between cytosolic crowding and ATP-driven motion that controls cellular functionality. Here, we investigated two distinct~fundamental features of the merely passive, non-biomotor-shuttled material transport within the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium discoideum cells: the anomalous non-linear scaling of the mean-squared displacement of a 150-nm-diameter particle and non-Gaussian distribution of increments. Relying on single-particle tracking data of 320,000 data points, we performed a systematic analysis of four possible origins for non-Gaussian transport: 1) sample-based variability, 2) rarely occurring strong motion events, 3) ergodicity breaking/aging, and 4) spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the intracellular medium. After excluding the first three reasons, we investigated the remaining hypothesis of a heterogeneous cytoplasm as cause for non-Gaussian transport. A, to our knowledge, novel fit model with randomly distributed diffusivities implementing medium heterogeneities suits the experimental data. Strikingly, the non-Gaussian feature is independent of the cytoskeleton condition and lag time. This reveals that~efficiency and consistency of passive intracellular transport and the related anomalous scaling of the mean-squared displacement are regulated by cytoskeleton components, whereas cytoplasmic heterogeneities are responsible for the generic, non-Gaussian distribution of increments.},

Using this data, the authors examine: (1) the comparative demographic and health characteristics of Internet versus land-based gamblers; (2) the characteristics predictive of Internet gambling; (3) the game-play patterns of Internet gamblers; (4) the comparative gambling expenditures of Internet versus land-based gamblers; and (5) the comparative rate of problem gambling among Internet versus land-based gamblers. The article concludes with a discussion of the methodological implications the present study holds for future research. Moreover, in light of the key finding that Internet gamblers are three to four times more likely to have a gambling problem, the article concludes with a discussion of relevant theoretical and policy implications.},

  abstract = {We study through a reaction-diffusion algorithm the influence of landscape diversity on the efficiency of search dynamics. Remarkably, the identical optimal search strategy arises in a wide variety of environments, provided the target density is sparse and the searcher's information is restricted to its close vicinity. Our results strongly impact the current debate on the emergentist vs. evolutionary origins of animal foraging. The inherent character of the optimal solution (i.e., independent on the landscape for the broad scenarios assumed here) suggests an interpretation favoring the evolutionary view, as originally implied by the L\'evy flight foraging hypothesis. The latter states that, under conditions of scarcity of information and sparse resources, some organisms must have evolved to exploit optimal strategies characterized by heavy-tailed truncated power-law distributions of move lengths. These results strongly suggest that L\'evy strategies---and hence the selection pressure for the relevant adaptations---are robust with respect to large changes in habitat. In contrast, the usual emergentist explanation seems not able to explain how very similar L\'evy walks can emerge from all the distinct non-L\'evy foraging strategies that are needed for the observed large variety of specific environments. We also report that deviations from L\'evy can take place in plentiful ecosystems, where locomotion truncation is very frequent due to high encounter rates. So, in this case normal diffusion strategies---performing as effectively as the optimal one---can naturally emerge from L\'evy. Our results constitute the strongest theoretical evidence to date supporting the evolutionary origins of experimentally observed L\'evy walks.}

The model incorporates an arbitrary distribution for the angles between successive steps in the tracks. Inclusion of a turning angle distribution enables explicit computation of the effect of persistence in the direction of travel on the expected magnitude of net displacement of the animal over time. We employed a form-analogous approach to obtain expressions for the expected net displacement and derived root mean square of the expected displacement of an animal at the end of a multi-step random walk in which turning angles were drawn from the Lemicon of Pascal, the elliptical, the von Mises, and the wrapped Cauchy distributions. The accuracy of these expressions for the expected magnitude of net displacement was tested by comparison with simulated results of persistent random walks where turning angles were drawn form the wrapped Cauchy distribution. Our results should be useful in predicting two-dimensional distribution of moving animals for which frequency distributions of the turning angles can be measured. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We demonstrate that the spontaneous emission from b3{$\Pi$}0(vb=0,jb=1) does not deteriorate the shielding process. This opens the possibility for a strong increase of the lifetime of cold molecule traps and for an efficient evaporative cooling.

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI plays a very important role in studying biological tissue structure and functioning both in health and disease. Proper interpretation of experimental data requires development of theoretical models that connect the diffusion MRI signal to salient features of tissue microstructure at the cellular level. In this review, we present some models (mostly, relevant to the brain) for describing diffusion attenuated MR signals. These range from the simplest approach, where the signal is described in terms of an apparent diffusion coefficient, to rather complicated models, where consideration is given to signals originating from extra- and intracellular spaces and where account is taken of the specific geometry and orientation distribution of cells. To better understand the characteristics of the diffusion attenuated MR signal arising from the complex structure of whole tissue, it is instructive to appreciate first the characteristics of the signal arising from simple single-cell-like structures. For this purpose, we also present here a theoretical analysis of models allowing exact analytical calculation of the MR signal, specifically, a single-compartment model with impermeable boundaries and a periodic structure of identical cells separated by permeable membranes. Such pure theoretical models give important insights into mechanisms contributing to the MR signal formation in the presence of diffusion. In this review we targeted both scientists just entering the MR field and more experienced MR researchers interested in applying diffusion methods to study biological tissues.

Our analysis demonstrates the validity of the local Stokes-Einstein--type relation DI{$\propto$}1/(Rg+R0), where R0{$\sim$}0.3 nm is assumed to be a hydration layer around the protein. From the analysis of different protein types with both strong and weak conformational fluctuations, the validity of the Stokes-Einstein--type relation appears to be a general property.},

Is there a way to improve the model to gain better results? To answer these questions, we use a dataset of 170 pairs having ``open'' and ``closed'' structures from Gerstein's protein motion database. Our results show that the conformational transitions fall into three categories: 1), the transitions of these proteins that can be explained well by ENM; 2), the transitions that are not explained well by ENM, but the results are significantly improved after considering the rigidity of some residue clusters and modeling them accordingly; and 3), the intrinsic nature of these transitions, specifically the low degree of collectivity, prevents their conformational changes from being represented well with the low frequency modes of any elastic network models. Our results thus indicate that the applicability of ENM for explaining conformational changes is not limited by the size of the studied protein or even the scale of the conformational change. Instead, it depends strongly on how collective the transition is.},

Rather than the cubic boxes, the effect of the rectangular boxes, which has been normally ignored, however, exhibits some distinct features, according to the hydrodynamics theory on molecular diffusion. In particular, the diffusion coefficient along the direction of the short side length of the box is always larger than that along the larger side length. What's unusual is that some components or even all three components of the diffusion coefficient may exceed that of an infinite system. Through the comparisons of the flow patterns excited by the diffusing particles, we find that the positive and negative corrections are linked to the local and global vortex of fluid, respectively.

We use these scaffolds to design artificial luciferases that selectively catalyse the oxidative chemiluminescence of the synthetic luciferin substrates diphenylterazine3 and 2-deoxycoelenterazine. The designed active sites position an arginine guanidinium group adjacent to an anion that develops during the reaction in a binding pocket with high shape complementarity. For both luciferin substrates, we obtain designed luciferases with high selectivity; the most active of these is a small (13.9\,kDa) and thermostable (with a melting temperature higher than 95\,{$^\circ$}C) enzyme that has a catalytic efficiency on diphenylterazine (kcat/Km\,=\,106\,M-1\,s-1)~comparable to that of native luciferases, but a much higher substrate specificity.

  abstract = {In large but finite populations, weak demographic stochasticity due to random birth and death events can lead to population extinction. The process is analogous to the escaping problem of trapped particles under random forces. Methods widely used in studying such physical systems, for instance, Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) and Fokker--Planck methods, can be applied to solve similar biological problems. In this article, we comparatively analyse applications of WKB and Fokker--Planck methods to some typical stochastic population dynamical models, including the logistic growth, endemic SIR, predator-prey, and competitive Lotka--Volterra models. The mean extinction time strongly depends on the nature of the corresponding deterministic fixed point(s). For different types of fixed points, the extinction can be driven either by rare events or typical Gaussian fluctuations. In the former case, the large deviation function that governs the distribution of rare events can be well-approximated by the WKB method in the weak noise limit. In the later case, the simpler Fokker--Planck approximation approach is also appropriate.},

Following application of topical formulations to human dermatomed skin for 30 min, penetration flux was observed for 24 h post dosing, using an in vitro flow-through skin diffusion system. Skin absorption and penetration was compared to the chemical-SC (intact, delipidized, or SC lipid film) binding levels. A significant vehicle effect was observed for chemical skin penetration and SC absorption. IPA resulted in the greatest levels of intact SC/SC lipid absorption, skin penetration, and total skin absorption/penetration of benzoic acid, followed by IPM and EtOH, respectively. For intact SC absorption and total skin absorption/penetration of butenafine, the vehicle that demonstrated the highest level of sorption/penetration was EtOH, followed by IPA and IPM, respectively. The percent doses of butenafine that were absorbed in SC lipid film and penetrated through skin in 24 h were greatest for IPA, followed by EtOH and IPM, respectively. The vehicle effect was consistent between intact SC absorption and total chemical skin absorption and penetration, as well as SC lipid absorption and chemical penetration through skin, suggesting intercellular transport as a main pathway of skin penetration for model chemicals. These results suggest the potential to predict vehicle effects on skin permeability with simple SC absorption assays. As decontamination was applied 30 min after chemical exposure, significant vehicle effects on chemical SC partitioning and percutaneous penetration also suggest that skin decontamination efficiency is vehicle dependent, and an effective decontamination method should act on chemical solutes in the lipid domain.},

This multicomponent system operates on coupled dynamics to reversibly store and release electricity. With the hierarchical electrode architectures inside LIBs, versatile functionality can be realized by design, while considerable difficulties remain to be solved to fully exploit the capability of each constituent. With the rapid electrification of the transportation sector and an urgent need to overhaul electric grids in the context of renewable energy penetration, demands for concomitant high energy and high power batteries are continuously increasing. Although building an ideal battery requires effort from multiple scientific and engineering aspects, it is imperative to gain insight into multiscale transport behaviors arising in both spatial and temporal dimensions, and enable their harmonic integration inside the whole battery system. In this progress report, recent research efforts on characterizing and understanding transport kinetics in LIBs are reviewed covering a broad range of electrode materials and length scales. To demonstrate the crucial role of such information in revolutionary electrode design, examples of innovative high energy/power electrodes are provided with their unique hierarchical porous architectures highlighted. To conclude, perspectives on further approaches toward advanced thick electrode designs with fast kinetics and tailored properties are discussed.},

On the basis of global dynamics of two subsystems, for the formulated Filippov system, we examine the sliding mode dynamics, the boundary equilibrium bifurcations, and the global dynamics. Our main results show that it is possible that the pseudo-equilibrium exists and is globally stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium, the disease-free equilibrium and the real equilibrium are tri-stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium and the real equilibrium are bi-stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium and disease-free equilibrium are bi-stable, which depend on the threshold value and other parameter values. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium or pseudo-equilibrium reveals that we may eradicate the disease or maintain the number of infected individuals at a previously given value. Further, the bi-stability and tri-stability imply that whether the number of infected individuals tends to zero or a previously given value or other positive values depends on the parameter values and the initial states of the system. This emphasizes the importance of threshold policy and challenges in the control of infectious diseases if without perfect vaccines.},

Synthetic cells as provided by giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) encapsulating macromolecules (poly(ethylene glycol) and dextran) represent an excellent mimetic system to study membrane transformations associated with molecular crowding and protein condensation. Similarly to cells, such GUVs exhibit highly curved structures like nanotubes. Upon liquid--liquid phase separation their membrane deforms into apparent kinks at the contact line of the interface between the two aqueous phases. These structures, nanotubes, and kinks, have dimensions below optical resolution. Here, these are studied with super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy facilitated by immobilization in a microfluidic device. The cylindrical nature of the nanotubes based on the superior resolution of STED and automated data analysis is demonstrated. The deduced membrane spontaneous curvature is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the membrane kink-like structure is resolved as a smoothly curved membrane demonstrating the existence of the intrinsic contact angle, which describes the wettability contrast of the encapsulated phases to the membrane. Resolving these highly curved membrane structures with STED imaging provides important insights in the membrane properties and interactions underlying cellular activities.},

  abstract = {In nature, bacteria must survive long periods of nutrient deprivation while maintaining the ability to recover and grow when conditions improve. This quiescent state is called stationary phase. The biochemistry of Escherichia coli in stationary phase is reasonably well understood. Much less is known about the biophysical state of the cytoplasm. Earlier studies of harvested nucleoids concluded that the stationary-phase nucleoid is ``compacted'' or ``supercompacted,'' and there are suggestions that the cytoplasm is ``glass-like.'' Nevertheless, stationary-phase bacteria support active transcription and translation. Here, we present results of a quantitative superresolution fluorescence study comparing the spatial distributions and diffusive properties of key components of the transcription-translation machinery in intact E. coli cells that were either maintained in 2-day stationary phase or undergoing moderately fast exponential growth. Stationary-phase cells are shorter and exhibit strong heterogeneity in cell length, nucleoid volume, and biopolymer diffusive properties. As in exponential growth, the nucleoid and ribosomes are strongly segregated. The chromosomal DNA is locally more rigid in stationary phase. The population-weighted average of diffusion coefficients estimated from mean-square displacement plots is 2-fold higher in stationary phase for both RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosomal species. The average DNA density is roughly twice as high as that in cells undergoing slow exponential growth. The data indicate that the stationary-phase nucleoid is permeable to RNAP and suggest that it is permeable to ribosomal subunits. There appears to be no need to postulate migration of actively transcribed genes to the nucleoid periphery.},

Here we consider the predicted behavior for assembly where the component reactions have weak association energy and are reversible and compare them to essentially irreversible reactions. The comparisons are based on mass action calculations and the behavior predicted from kinetic simulations where assembly is described as a cascade of low order reactions. Reversible reactions are characterized by a pseudo-critical concentration, whereas irreversible reactions consume all free subunits. Irreversible reactions are more susceptible to kinetic traps comprised of numerous small intermediates. In the case where only the ultimate step is irreversible, very low concentrations of intermediates slow the completion of the reaction so that overall it closely matches the predictions for the reversible reactions that make up the majority of the cascade. Data in the literature strongly support the hypothesis that most viruses are held together by many weak interactions.},

  pages = {15},
  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide explicit formulas for a variety of probabilistic quantities associated with an asymmetric random walk on a finite rectangular lattice with absorbing barriers. Quantities of interest include probabilities that a walker will exit the lattice onto some particular set of boundary states, the expected duration of the walk, and the expected number of visits to one state given a start in another. These quantities are shown to satisfy two-dimensional recurrence relations that are very similar in structure. In each case, the recurrence relations may be represented by matrix equations of the form X = AX + XB + C, where A and B are tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices. The spectral properties ofA and B are investigated and used to provide solutions to this matrix equation. The solutions to the matrix equations then lead to solutions for the recurrence relations in very general cases.},

Yet no method existed to correlate the guests' motion with the structure of the material. This looks set to change with the development of a technique combining electron microscopy with optical single-molecule tracking to visualize molecular diffusion in a mesoporous material. For the first time, guest molecules (dyes in this case) can be 'seen' changing speed or direction in response to structural features of the host on a nanometre scale. This opens the way to a deeper understanding of the properties of mesoporous solids.},

  abstract = {The theory of the kinetics of binding of ligands to a sphere partially covered by receptors is extended to provide the full time dependence of the reactive flux. The ligands diffuse to the receptors; the receptors are either fully or partially absorbing. The total flux into the sphere with many receptors is expressed analytically in terms of the flux into a single isolated receptor on the sphere. At steady state, the Berg-Purcell formula is generalized to the case where the binding to a single receptor is only partially diffusion controlled. At short times, the receptors behave independently and the total flux is the sum of the fluxes to the isolated receptors.},
