* Overview
A long-term research programme to build a rigorous mathematical theory of evolution
as a stochastic process on an infinite-dimensional state space, coupling:

- trait distributions (densities or measures),
- dynamic environment fields,
- feedback between population and environment,
- mutation, migration, selection,
- demographic and environmental noise,
- external physical constraints (physics, energy input, etc.).

Core objectives:

- Define invariant and quasi-invariant measures on trait–environment state spaces.
- Characterise metastable structures corresponding to species or phenotype clusters.
- Describe convergent evolution as measure concentration on robust attractors.
- Develop a large deviation theory for macro-evolutionary transitions.
- Identify universality classes of evolutionary dynamics.


* Conceptual framework
Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ be the physical space, and $\xi \in \mathbb{R}$ the space of traits for the animal population. 
Then $u : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to [0,\infty)$ denotes the population density, so that at each time $t$ we have 
$u_t(\cdot,\cdot) \in H_u$, an appropriate function space (for example $H_u = L^2(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R})$ or a Sobolev space on $\mathbb{R}^2$).

Let $\eta \in \mathbb{R}$ represent an environmental trait, mirroring $\xi$ for the animals, and let 
$v : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to [0,\infty)$ be the density of the environment field, so that $v_t(\cdot,\cdot) \in H_v$ for a suitable function space $H_v$.

We introduce a small parameter $\epsilon > 0$ that controls the separation of timescales between the animal dynamics and the environment,
and a gauge function $\alpha(\epsilon)$ with $\alpha(\epsilon) \to 0$ as $\epsilon \to 0$. 
The coupled dynamics are given abstractly by the SPDE system
#+NAME: eq-proposed-model
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{d}u_t(x,\xi)
  &= \bigl[ A_u u_t + F_u(u_t, v_t) \bigr](x,\xi)\,\mathrm{d}t
     + \bigl[ G_u(u_t, v_t)\,\mathrm{d}W_t^u \bigr](x,\xi), \\[0.7em]
\mathrm{d}v_t(x,\eta)
  &= \sqrt{\alpha}\bigl[ A_v v_t + F_v(u_t, v_t) \bigr](x,\eta)\,\mathrm{d}t + \alpha \bigl[ G_v(u_t, v_t)\,\mathrm{d}W_t^v \bigr](x,\eta),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
- $A_u : D(A_u) \subset H_u \to H_u$ and $A_v : D(A_v) \subset H_v \to H_v$ are (typically) linear operators 
      (for example, diffusion operators in $x$ and possibly in $\xi$ or $\eta$),
- $F_u : H_u \times H_v \to H_u$ and $F_v : H_u \times H_v \to H_v$ are nonlinear functionals describing eco--evolutionary drift 
      (selection, interaction, feedback),
- $G_u$ and $G_v$ are noise coefficient operators, and $W_t^u$, $W_t^v$ are cylindrical Wiener processes on suitable Hilbert spaces.
The factor $\alpha$ present in the evolution of $v_t$ is to ensure that the environment evolves on a slower time scale than $u_t$ as $\epsilon \to 0$. The different powers are of course due to the different time scales naturally present in a Weiner noise and to preseve the Ito table. 



** Objects
- $A(t)$: population trait distribution
  - either as a density $u_t(x, \xi)$ on space $x$ and trait $\xi$,
  - or as a probability measure on trait space (possibly with spatial index).
- $E(t)$: environment fields
  - resources, abiotic conditions, temperature, etc.
- $S$: external constraints
  - physics, solar input, planetary parameters, etc.
    
** Mathematical realisations
- Coupled SPDE systems on space × trait domains.
- Spatial Fleming–Viot measure-valued processes with selection and mutation.
- Infinite-dimensional SDEs with ecological feedback in the drift term.

** Biological interpretation
- Fitness landscapes are emergent properties of the generator (drift + noise).
- Species correspond to metastable attractors or basins in the stochastic dynamics.
- Convergent evolution corresponds to repeated occupation of the same attractors
  from different initial conditions and histories.

* Conceptual issues and how they map to mathematics

** Issue 1: “Predefined minima” and predestination
Concern:
- If the dynamics have fixed minima, it looks as though species are predetermined.

Mathematical reframing:
- Attractors are properties of the generator, not Platonic “species”.
- Evolution is the random trajectory that:
  - selects which attractors are realised,
  - determines basins actually visited,
  - determines the time spent in each basin.

Mathematical tools:
- Invariant and quasi-invariant measures.
- Metastability and basins of attraction.
- Ergodic components of infinite-dimensional Markov processes.

** Issue 2: Fixed vs wandering parameters
Concern:
- Fixed parameters theta:
  - single “landscape”; why this one?
- Wandering parameters theta(t):
  - ensemble average over landscapes; does this wash out structure?

Key points:
- Ergodicity relates time averages to the invariant measure,
  not to a uniform distribution.
- Selection and constraints bias the invariant measure heavily.
- Feedback A–E breaks symmetries and generates structure.

Mathematical tools:
- Ergodic theory for SPDE / measure-valued processes.
- Parameter dependence and structural stability of invariant measures.

** Issue 3: Convergent evolution vs ergodicity
Concern:
- Naively, ergodic systems “explore everything”; but we observe convergence
  to similar body plans (e.g. crabs, camera eyes).

Resolution:
- Invariant measures can be extremely non-uniform.
- Large deviation barriers make many regions of state space effectively inaccessible.
- Convergent evolution is evidence of:
  - robust, structurally stable attractors,
  - large basins of attraction in phenotype space.

Mathematical tools:
- Support and concentration of invariant measures.
- Freidlin–Wentzell theory and quasipotential.
- Large deviations and metastability in infinite dimensions.

** Issue 4: Fine-tuning and “uniqueness”
Concern:
- Why does the invariant measure concentrate on particular macro-phenotypes?
- Why these stable forms, not others?

Resolution ideas:
- Universality classes:
  - broad ranges of parameters generate similar macro-attractors.
- Structural stability:
  - attractors persist under small parameter changes.
- Conditioning:
  - we are implicitly conditioning on worlds that support long-lived evolution.

Mathematical tasks:
- Show robustness of attractors under parameter perturbations.
- Identify coarse structures that are invariant across model variants.
- Describe “typical” behaviour within a class of generators.

* Candidate model classes

** Trait–environment SPDE systems
Objects:
- u(t, x, xi): population density over space x and trait xi.
- e(t, x): environment field over space x.

Dynamics:
- Diffusion in x and possibly xi.
- Selection terms depending on u and e.
- Feedback from u to e (resource consumption, modification of environment).
- Demographic and environmental noise.

Why this class matters:
- Direct mathematical realisation of the A–E–S picture.
- Fits naturally into SPDE frameworks (Da Prato–Zabczyk, Hairer, Walsh).
- Good testbed for:
  - existence and uniqueness theory,
  - invariant measures,
  - SPDE-based LDP.

** Spatial Fleming–Viot processes
Objects:
- At each spatial site (or continuous space), a probability measure on trait space.
- Global state is a measure-valued process indexed by space.

Mechanisms:
- Resampling (genetic drift).
- Mutation.
- Migration between sites.
- Selection.

Why this class matters:
- Already rigorously developed.
- Direct roots in population genetics.
- Spatial Fleming–Viot with selection and mutation (Dawson–Greven)
  is very close to the envisioned eco-evo population piece.
- Existing LDP work (Dawson–Feng) gives a foundation for rare-event analysis.

** Adaptive dynamics in high or infinite-dimensional trait spaces
Idea:
- Start from adaptive dynamics (trait substitution sequences) in finite-dimensional traits.
- Extend to:
  - function-valued traits,
  - high-dimensional phenotype vectors.

Why this class matters:
- Bridges existing biological theory with the more abstract SPDE and MV frameworks.
- Could provide:
  - deterministic PDE/IDE limits,
  - intuition about branching and singular strategies in more complex settings.

* Criticisms and Defences
A structured list of potential weaknesses in the research vision, followed by corresponding defences. 
This is written from the perspective of an applied mathematician with background in mathematical physics 
working on biological systems (microtubules), moving into SPDE and eco–evolutionary modelling.

** Scope vs Feasibility
*** Criticism
The overall programme appears too large: SPDE well-posedness, invariant measures, large deviations, 
metastability, universality, and biological interpretation. A panel may argue that this is too broad for a 3–5 year fellowship.

*** Defence
The broad picture is a long-term vision. The proposal itself is decomposed into independent, realistic work packages:
- WP1: well-posedness for a specific coupled SPDE;
- WP2: existence/uniqueness of invariant measures under explicit assumptions;
- WP3: LDP for a simplified measure-valued (Fleming–Viot) component.
Each WP is achievable and corresponds to a standalone publication. The large programme is a roadmap, not a workload.

** Background vs Difficulty
*** Criticism
The technical areas (SPDE, functional analysis, measure-valued processes, LDPs) are demanding. Reviewers may question whether the applicant has the background.

*** Defence
Early work packages require only standard techniques (analytic semigroups, Lipschitz drift/noise, compactness arguments).
The project includes structured skill acquisition in Year 1, supported by current research on microtubule SPDE models.
Existing experience in mathematical physics ensures comfort with PDE, variational methods, and operator theory. 
The first publications do not require deep SPDE machinery.

** 3. Precision of Mathematical Goals
*** Criticism
The abstract formulation may seem vague: no explicit theorems, assumptions, or domain specifications.

*** Defence
The proposal includes precise target theorems, e.g.:
- existence and uniqueness of mild solutions in \(H_u \times H_v\);
- existence (and possibly uniqueness) of invariant measures under coercivity;
- LDP for a spatial Fleming–Viot process.
All operators (A_u, A_v) and spaces (H_u, H_v) are specified in the formal work plan. 
The vision is broad but the mathematical goals are explicitly defined.

** Novelty vs Existing Literature
*** Criticism
Parts of the framework resemble Dawson–Greven (spatial FV), Dawson–Feng (LDP), or eco–evo SPDE in biology.
Reviewers may question novelty.

*** Defence
Novelty lies in unifying:
- continuous traits,
- continuous environmental traits,
- spatial structure,
- rigorous SPDE formulation,
- feedback loops between fields.
Existing works handle subsets; none treat fully continuous eco–evolutionary SPDE with two interacting function-valued fields, 
nor do they analyse invariant measures + metastability for such systems.

** Biological Anchoring
*** Criticism
The biological motivation might appear too generic (e.g. convergent evolution) and vaguely connected to the SPDE.

*** Defence
Each term in the SPDE has a direct biological analogue:
- spatial diffusion = dispersal,
- trait diffusion = mutation,
- feedback F_u and F_v = resource–consumer or niche-modifying interactions,
- environmental trait η = temperature/resource quality dimension.
The project captures mechanisms seen in consumer–resource systems, host–parasite systems, and convergent evolution patterns.
Biological relevance is grounded in mechanism, not metaphor.

** Notation and Modelling Consistency
*** Criticism
Minor inconsistencies (v vs η, choice of H_u, timescale direction) may suggest lack of polish.

*** Defence
All symbols are now fixed and consistent. 
Final SPDE is written in a standard Da Prato–Zabczyk framework with:
- explicit H_u and H_v,
- consistent domains for A_u and A_v,
- explicit Lipschitz and growth assumptions.
Early notation inconsistencies were part of exploratory drafting; the final model is clean and rigorous.

** Methodological Risk
*** Criticism
Full LDP or metastability for highly nonlinear SPDE may be too ambitious.

*** Defence
The proposal is structured with fallback cases:
- start with simplified, globally Lipschitz SPDE;
- if needed, reduce to the measure-valued component for LDP;
- metastability can be studied for a reduced slow–fast limit.
This is standard practice in probability proposals. The “hard” results are optional extensions.

** Timescale Separation Scaling
*** Criticism
The α(ε)-scaling for the environment may look ad hoc or loosely justified.

*** Defence
The chosen scaling is standard in slow–fast SPDE:
- drift scales like ε,
- noise scales like √ε,
from the Brownian scaling W_{εt} = √ε W_t.
This is consistent with homogenisation (Pavliotis–Stuart), Cerrai’s SPDE averaging theorems, and classical Khasminskii theory.
The scaling is mathematically grounded.

** Outputs and Success Criteria
*** Criticism
It may be unclear what the concrete deliverables are.

*** Defence
The project lists four realistic and self-contained outputs:
1. well-posedness for a coupled eco–evo SPDE;
2. invariant measures for the same system;
3. LDP for a spatially structured FV model;
4. metastability analysis for the slow–fast regime.
Each is a natural paper-scale result deliverable within the fellowship.

** Interdisciplinary Positioning
*** Criticism
Risk that pure mathematicians see it as too biological, and biologists see it as too abstract.

*** Defence
The project provides two complementary entry points:
- A fully rigorous mathematical formulation (SPDE, measure-valued processes, invariant measures, LDP),
- A mechanistic biological mapping (mutation, dispersal, niche feedback, convergent evolution).
This allows the proposal to be read from either angle. The applicant’s background in mathematical physics ensures fluency in both directions.
